Xiaomei's research 

* notes

** <2017-07-12 Wed 10:00>
   - novelty
     - intuitive control interface in endoscopic view
     - use PQ information to update the controller
   - did simulation of catheter forward kinematics 
     - 
   - to do parallel (KW)
     - three components
       - EM tracking
       - subject test interface
       - robot
     - EM tracking and interface
       - first try interfacing EM tracking and the subject test interface (the london one )
	 - by hand playing a traditional catheter in a virtual environment
	   - the purpose is to get how good we can control the traditional catheter
	 - need to ask Brian for the code and practice it ASAP
	   - unity 3D
     - robot
       - the current slave robot with 3DOF 
	 - without the coarse insertion
       - help ziyang to build the robot
     - catheter
       - the traditional catheter may not good to control
       - but we need some new catheter
	 - ask Martin
       - estimate the fabrication time of the Kaspar's catheter

   - progressed on writing the methodology about the mri-distortion
   - 
** <2016-12-09 Fri 16:00> 
   - the mri-distortion estimation is in fact a homogeneous linear eqaution Ax = 0;
   - It needs to further investigate how to solve it.
   - I suggested to solve it by linear programming, using slack variable x_n = \xi x_{n+1}
   - suggested to simplify the writing of methodology
     
** DONE discuss about the solution of the mri-distortion parameters
   CLOSED: [2016-12-05 Mon 16:59] SCHEDULED: <2016-12-05 Mon 16:00>
   - told her to write a 1 page methodology
     - concisely write down the problem definition
     - simplify the equations for the ease of discussion
     - put all complicated arithmetic in appendix
   - told her to contact Brian to buy the VR set
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2016-12-05 Mon 16:59]
* progress
** <2016-12-02 Fri>
   - The Transoral surgical project
   - tried to solve the mri distortion parameters estimation problem
     - the problem could be solve by linear algebra
     - but the data currently is not so accurate
   - aim for higher impact factor journal
     - try to thing about the story of the mri distortion
