**** neurorobot
- 1st version
- planar backlash is reduced
- Workspace is enough
- still a bit backlash
**** future work
- try to use servo to drive the pair of rolling diaphragm
- Develop of kinematic of the robot in matlab
- Telsa turbine
- kawai suggest consider "cycrops" mechanism
- bring the 2nd prototype to Dr. Danny Chan
