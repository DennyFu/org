Ziyan's research
* progress

   - HIFU
     - mri distortion is a known-problem
     - use laser to rise temperature
   - only GE provide MRI distortion model
     - use nonlinear gradient
     - aim for faster imaging 
   - motor paper
     - revised paper
     - still revising a good way to present the idea of the motor family
   - neuro paper
     - revised some figures
       - took out the small figures out from the table
       - add some latest
     - KW:
       - may need to revise the text also about the motor
	 - more understandable by doctors
       - remove the motor figure
       - search for more target journals?
       - also check the writing format
** <2016-12-02 Fri>
   - get submit the neuro review paper by christmas
     - fix the figures
     - discuss between martin, me and ziyan
   - how to overcome the distortion
     - in MRI HIFU
     - in MRI radiotherapy
   - how to use MR thermometry for mri distortion
   - think about how to introduce our work
     - aim for high impact papers
     - intraoperative mri
     - due with mri distortion
   - expectation
     - prepare ppt about our work
       - the impacts
     - the neurorobot review paper
     - 
** 9 Aug 2016
*** Neuro robot
- 
*** Catheter robot
*** motor upgrade
- model modified
  - 7 motors with different parameters
- need a torque sensor
  - kawai: can go for buy suitable sensor
- Ziyan suggest for TMECH
  - kawai suggest
    - for ICRA letter
    - ask dr zhou for FEA simulation of puematic acutation


** 21 Jul 2016
*** Needle insertion
**** forward and inverse kinematics 
**** workspace analysis 50 cm^2
**** error analysis 0.2mm/1degree
**** registration scheme
**** difficulities
***** long stroke
****** try to solve by continuous motor
***** actuator 
****** hydraulic
****** cable driven
****** mount motor on the needle guide
****** need optical encoder
*** Catheter robot
**** new phantom
***** 
*** motor upgrade
**** modify models
*** Ka-wai
**** close pneumatic motor and submit to a journal 
***** assign experiments to family pueumatic motor
