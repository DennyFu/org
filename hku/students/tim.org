Tim's research
* progress
** <2016-12-19 Mon 10:30>
   - progress on literature review
     - soft robotic background
     - sensing is the key challenge for control
     - fiber optics
     - load estimation
   - next meeting will be after new year holiday
     - put more points on the soft robotics development
     - add other sensing modalities before "shape sensing"
** <2016-12-12 Mon 15:00>
   - the experimental validation will be mainly simulations
   - novelty
     - control framework using optical sensing for localization of force based on morphological change
     - not to fight for against LUNA, but a control framework that LUNA can also work 
   - expectation in the next meeting
     - paragraphs of the literature review
   
** <2016-12-02 Fri 11:00>
   - direction
     - localization of force of soft robots based on morphological change
     - the morphology of the soft robot is learned offline
   - expectation  in the next meeting
     - more progress on the literatue review (chapter 2) 
     - idea of the experimental platform
** <2016-11-28 Mon>
   - meeting for the thesis
     - Table of content
       - Literature review
	 - what is the importance of our design rather than the others (e.g. LUNA)
	 - AI-based morphological sensing
     - one channel optical fiber
   - next meeting will be on 2nd Dec morning
     - progress on the literature review
       - the logical flow 

** <2016-09-07 Wed>
- molded sensors (100mm)
- unexpected spectral behaviour
  - uneven strain along sensor
  - partial slippage occurs inside the embedded environment
  - maynot be cause by spectrum shifted after embedded into the silicon
- need longer to test S-curve sensing
  - expected separated spectrum 



** 9 Aug 2016
*** FEA simulation
**** silicone model
**** fiber model
*** CFBG simulation
- interesting method from strain data to specturm frequency
*** CFBG testing
*** literature
- kawai ask for literature review (chapter 2)



** 21 Jul 2016
**** chirped fiber bragg grating (CFBG) test was done
***** spectual response
***** tracking platform was built
****** 3 cameras
**** Ka-wai
***** can it be less fragile (Ka-wai)
***** find out mathematical model by next week
****** element model and material(substrate) model
***** draft the
