*** Performance Aware programming
- identify the computation bottleneck
  - bottleneck in memory access
- proposed acceleration
  - accelerate both process using FPGA
  - adopting pixel shift register to minimize bandwidth requirement
- kawai
  - better to focus on developing a user-friendly open source code 
    - a common series of scalable GPU
      - modular GPU
    - optimization memory access strategy
    - not necessarily focus on FPGA-based
  - TMI
