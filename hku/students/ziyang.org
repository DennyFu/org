   - existing force motor
     - DYNAMIXEL
     - KW: go to order quickly
   - Dynamic model
     -

   - suggested solving the problem by constrained optimization
     - quadratic programming
     - minimum force input to produce constant torque output
       - the constant torque output is one of the constrain
       - the minimum force can be a quadratic objective function
   - the force calculation is correct
     - correct free body diagram
   - suggest to simplify the writing of methodology
   
** <2016-12-02 Fri>
   - need to search for force-controlled motors for experimentation
   - can also buy velocity-based controlled motors for experimentation
   - design something new different from crane shaft
     - how to put the 3 pistons
   - writing
   - expectation in next meeting
     - writing of the methodology
     - some solidwork design of the motor
     - order the motors

*** literature review
- commercial catheter robotic platform
  - Sensei X
  - Amigo system
    - can mount with a clinically-used catheter
  - Magnetic field actuated
    - Niobe magnetic navigation system
    - M.A. Tavallaei et al.
    - master-slave system
      - master: the control interface
      - non-magnetic ultrasonic motors (slave)
    - non-magnetic metals, plastic
      - SNR dropped less than 3%
  - MRI/fMRI-compatible robotic system with force feedback for interaction with human motion
    - Roger Gassert et al.
    - hydraulic

*** Ka-wai feedback
- need to know more about the trend
- horizon scanning
  - e.g.
  - what is the trend
  - future development
  - what are the other's work
  - how's your research is related to the others

** 9 Aug 2016
*** RAM paper
*** improvement of catheter robot design
- master part enhancement using metal 

*** Markforged printer cannot deliver to HK until 2017
*** future design
*** ask su-lin about the ablation target and then prepare data by manually control the robot 



** 21 Jul 2016
*** RAM
**** technical description by this weekend
*** neurorobot design
*** reassembly of catheter robot
**** by 26
*** PWH 3D printer problem
*** Evaluation of Surgical robot challenge
**** component strength
***** parts in control room should 
**** less belt
**** theoretical analysis
*** purchase printers
**** Markforged
*** Ka-wai
**** source one more printer
***** unique, well-differentiated from existing
***** draft 
***** improve not only linear, but improve to get rid of stroke-length limitation
