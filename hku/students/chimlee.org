Chimlee's research
* notes 
** to myself
- need to learn more technical details
  - sensing principle
  - the use of network analyzer
- well this is to prevent the lost of knowledge if Chimlee leave

* progress
** <2016-12-19 Mon 12:15>
   - quite organized table of content was shown
   - hiring people for this coil project
     - EEE people?
     - MEMS people?
     - 
   - prospective collaboration with CUHK side
     - Dr. Weitian Chen
   - 
   - next week monday
     - literature review of chapter 2
     - demonstration of network analyzer

** <2016-09-07 Wed>
- Patent
  - last 20 years patent
    - potential direction
      - design and optimization
      - addictive fabrication
      - 

** 9 Aug 2016
*** semi-active coil
- 9 layers
- 134 and 135 MHz results
- Successful detunig with PIN photodiode + Detuning Capacitor
  - @ 110 MHz
  - delta 1MHz
- testing platform (kawai suggestion)
  - at the tip of 4 飲管
  - optical fibers
    - need to find a better method for cutting optical fibers
  - laser source
  - how to locate the center of the sensor
    - frequency domain data
    - 
  - FEA results next time
