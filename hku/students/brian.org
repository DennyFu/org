- Jack and Terrance for the progress of IMU
  - IMU use accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope to get the orientation information of
- target task: velocity-control to differentiate from FPG optical fiber sensor.
  - my opinion, need also to differentiate from other existing sensors which can sense velocity 

- Chimlee opinion
  - wireless communication of IMUs to an external RF module
  - but cannot use the magnetometer in the IMUs
  - a kind of wireless charging technology
  - RF -> DC
