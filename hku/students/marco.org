Marco's research
* progress
** <2016-12-19 Mon 19:00>
   - no table of content for discussion of the flow
   - the main concern is the attitude
     - he lacks of attitude solving a given problem
     - he stops thinking solutions
     - if he wants to improve himself, he will at least ask or take reference from others
   - it seems that he put little time and effort for the literature review
     - not so much points were shown
     - the points were not well-organized as logical flow of literature review -- why the research is so important?
   - it might be he lacks of experience in writing, he doesn't know how to start and write a thesis
   - let see if he shows some change of his attitude and motivation
   - KW seems frustrate with his performance

   - fabricated a collimator prototype
   - the actuation soft cushion requires 3D printer
   - so the work until next meeting will all focus on the literature review writing
     - the logical flow of the literature
     - enough literature
     - organize in paragraphs
     - organized bullet points
** <2016-12-02 Fri 09:45>
   - need more progress on the literature review
   - fabricate a cavity platform based on MRI data
   - tasks to do
     - literature review
     - FEM analysis
     - robot prototype
   - expectation on the next meeting
     - progress on the literature 
** <2016-11-28 Mon>
   - meeting for the thesis
     - no need to put focus on the tracking
   - Table of content
     - Literature review
   - got some data from the internet
     - had preliminary 3D model for the reconstruction 
   - next meeting will be on 2nd Dec morning
     - progress on the literature review
       - the logical flow

*** 3D printable
- with folded sleeve
- to get faster integration
- ~135 angle
- 

*** Kawai
- FEA worth?
  - brian: may not be necessary because the idea is pretty simple
  - 
- a soft cushion laser pointer

** 9 Aug 2016
*** 3D printable hyper-elastic actuator
- can bend > 90 angle
- kawai 
  - how to apply to the laser project
  - how to encode the laser pointing
    - what MR sequence is sensitive to temperatures (<45 degree)
    - optical calibration 

** 21 Jul 2016
*** 3d printable hyper-elastic actuator
**** no need multi-stage molding
**** enabling digital printing
***** solution provided by companies?
*** MR-compatible actuator using soft pop-ups
*** Ka-wai
**** contact leo
**** literature
***** focus on surgical application or design mechanism but not the frabrication process
