* meeting notes

** notes - 13-oct

*** kawai 
- Ian want to collect all the license for patented technologies from existing companies
- he also wants to wait for a good timing to buy those companies

- ian and kawai will talk to imaco (the competitive company) to ask about their progress

- key components need to develop
  - tracking system
  - mri actuation

- think about the story of presenting the automatic mri distortion calibration instead of phantom approach 


*** ziyan
- pneumatic motor
  - not very consistence with the hypothesis currently because of the measurement error
  - will continue the experiment
  - 
- neuro robot
  - relation to the image registration problem

*** xiaomei
- studied rigid and non-rigid registrations
  - a method uses GMM model with EM optimization


*** ziyang
- dynamic modeling of the continuous motor






** notes - 7-oct
*** kawai's 
 - billionairs Ian want us to provide a global market revenue
   - to ziyan
 - 
*** ziyang - 7-oct
**** continuous motor using rolling diaphragm
 - need to check the equation of torque, why it will become negative?
 - kawai's 
   - important to find out the tricks of the making the hydraulic motor which can give constant torque
*** xiaomei - 7- oct
**** searching for parameters by constrained optimization problem
*** ziyan progress - 7 -oct
**** pneumatic motor
 - collect data for pnuematic motor
   - kawai's comments
     - noise is the problem for practical application
     - don't need to keen on make the pnuematic motor work
 - hydraulic motor
   - only one cylinder takes main effect one time
 - neuro robot 
   - mri gradient model needs 36 coefficients
     - some use only 8 to achieve 0.2 mm 
** estimating MRI image distortion - 2016-09-29
*** The sources of distortion
 - could be sorted as: 1) inhomogeneity in the static magnetic field, namely the imperfect uniformity of the  field (only along frequency encoded directions / read encode and slice select directions); 2) object-induced distortions (only along frequency encoded directions / read encode and slice select directions); 3) gradient nonlinearities (each of the three cardinal directions).

 - why we use robot to take calibration over phantom
   - robot could provide flexibility to adjust the sequence



 - how the gradient affect the distortion?
   - the effects in different

 - check out the distortion formulations
   - e.g. distortions due to imperfections in the B_0 field and to susceptibility effects

*** the distortion 
 D(P(alpha+error), theta) = P_mri
 - D: function/operator
 - alpha: robot joint
 - P: coil position in the image coordinate
 - theta: model parameter
