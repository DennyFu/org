Dear Chief Editor,

I am writing for a few equiries about our recent submission titled “Nonparametric Local Learning for Hyper-Elastic Robotics Control: An Enabling Technique for Effective Endoscopic Navigation” (ID: TMECH-02-2016-5183) to the Focused Section Mechatronics in Soft Robotics of the IEEE Transaction on Mechatronics.

We received a decision on 8th May 2016, which contains comments from 9 reviewers. (The decision letter is attached for your reference.)
In order to prepare a revised paper within the tight schedule of the focused section, we have contacted the associate editor about the deadline for resubmission. However, there is no reply.

Regarding our submission, we would like to enquire about the following issues:
1. Could you please provide the average number of reviewers for each submission in this focused section? and in regular submission? 
   As discussed with experienced colleagues, we believe that a decision based on 9 reviewers' comments is unusual.
Especially for the focused section, preparing high-quality replies to all the 9 reviewers' comments within designated is difficult.
Thus, we conceive that the decision with 9 reviewers comments was a subtle way to discourage us from resubmission in the same focused section. 
2. Is there any filtering process for the reviewers' comments?
   We found that the 9 reviewers' comments are diverging. Some reviewers lack technical knowledge that misunderstood our manuscript. For example, a reviewer misunderstood that we employed neutral network; However, we employed a nonparametric local learning technique called LWPR, which is not a neutral network algorithm. In addition to the number of the reviewer, the quality of the comments also introduce difficulties to improve our manuscript.
3. Generally, is a resubmission deadline is included in the decision letter for a focused section?
   Although the deadline for submission of revised paper is provided in the focused section, it is not updated; 
   Due to the postponement of the paper submission, we received the decision almost a month later than that provided on the web.
   We believe it is impossible to prepare a revised manuscript that includes response to all the 9 reviewers, by the provided deadline of submission of revised paper on 1st June.


Thank you for your attention. 
We are looking forward to your kind response.

Yours sincerely,

    Dear Dr. Tsang,

    How are you? It has been long time since we had the gathering at your place.
    We are fine here. The two children are growing up quickly and having angle smiles everyday.
    My sister and her husband are both doing good as usual.
    It was very lucky that my father discovered a stage 1 cancer near the semi-colon this April,
    and had a successful MIS that completely remove the tumour.
    He is now recovered and living as usual that taking care of the us everyday.
    I moved back to Hong Kong since last December. If everything goes fine, I will get the PhD degree this September.
    
    I'm now working at the University of Hong Kong in a Lab doing surgical robotics.
    I'm going to London from 21 Jun to 3 Jul for a about surgical robotics symposium held in the Imperial College London.
    It will be great if we can meet each other.

    Best,
    Denny
