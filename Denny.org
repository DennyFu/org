    Dear Dr. Tsang,

    How are you? It has been long time since we had the gathering at your place.
    We are fine here. The two children are growing up quickly and having angle smiles everyday.
    My sister and her husband are both doing good as usual.
    It was very lucky that my father discovered a stage 1 cancer near the semi-colon this April,
    and had a successful MIS that completely remove the tumour.
    He is now recovered and living as usual that taking care of the us everyday.
    I moved back to Hong Kong since last December. If everything goes fine, I will get the PhD degree this September.
    
    I'm now working at the University of Hong Kong in a Lab doing surgical robotics.
    I'm going to London from 21 Jun to 3 Jul for a about surgical robotics symposium held in the Imperial College London.
    It will be great if we can meet each other.

    Best,
    Denny
