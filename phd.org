** overview

*** motivation
to show why the research is important

**** benefits of musculoskeletal robots
***** more dexterous
***** more safe
***** versatile

**** potential applications
***** replacing human work
      example figure
***** medical applications
      example figure

**** control difficulties hinders real applications
***** difficult to control many muscles and many joints
***** difficult to obtain analytical model

**** a fly-in block: 
     how to control musculoskeletal systems?


*** bio-inspired control strategy -- muscle synergies
to introduce what is muscle synergies
(biological creatures face the control difficulties...)

**** a muscle synergy =  co-activation of muscles
      figure of muscle synergies decomposition

**** reduces control dimensionality
      pointer to indicate controller that computes synergy activation

**** A big fly-in block: 
      can it be applied in musculoskeletal robots?
      how can a robot obtain muscle synergies?
      (this thesis studies about these two questions....)


*** Thesis overview
    to give an overview of the research study
    
**** with the two questions in the previous slides

**** a process chart showing the 3 parts


*** Definition - muscle synergies
    to notice time invariant synergies are studied

**** Time invariant synergies
     - Fixed muscle co-activation for all time
     - equation

**** Dimensionality reduction 
     - dim(a) â‰¤ dim(u)

**** extraction of synergies
     - Tools perform linear matrix factorization with conceptual diagram
       - Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
       - Principle component analysis


*** Definition - musculoskeletal system
    to notice linear muscles are studied

**** linear muscle model
     - equations of linear relation to control u
       - force output
       - torque output
     - figure of a simple arm model

**** Nonlinear systems that are affine in control
     - equation of motion: indicate affine in control
     - equivalent state space equations with end effector output
     
**** A human-like robotic arm simulator
     - 3 joints, 10 muscles,
     - move on horizontal plane
     - figure


** part 1
   
*** Motivation
    To show the objective is to verify the feasibility of utilizing synergies
    
    - preceded by the thesis overview slide showing the two issues

**** Objective (concerning about the two questions in overview)
     - to verify feasibility of dimensionality reduction in control
       - utilizing synergies in control
     - to get some hints about synergies extraction
       (the problem of how to extract is about studying innate properties of data sample source)
       - study synergies sets that inherit different properties (optimality)

**** related work
     - Chharab's work where time varying synergies were investigated

*** Methodology
    Briefly description

**** Comparison of synergies extracted from individually optimized control signals ~ 1 slide

***** conceptual diagram
      optimize control signals by certain criterion -> synergies -> control problem
      several flow lines

***** the control problem: reaching task of the human-like robotic arm
      - show figure

***** Different ways of generating data sample source
      - Optimized by goal-related criterion -> achieving-goal synergies
      - optimized by different goal-unrelated criteria -> fitness-optimized synergies
        - weaker constraint on the optimization criterion

***** Capable to solve the control problem in reduced control dimensionality -> Feasible synergies

**** Obtaining Achieving goal synergies

**** Obtaining Fitness-optimized synergies

*** Results and discussion
**** Utilizing achieving goal synergies
**** Comparison with fitness optimized synergies
*** Conclusion
**** Verified synergies can reduce control dimensionality
**** Implications
**** Limitations
***** Require known analytical model
*** Related publications

** part 2

   - A copy of thesis overview slide

*** Motivation

    - figure: big cross on EMG-signals and equations + box with text:how to extract synergies?
**** Proper data sample is given in most literature
     - EMG
     - optimized data sample (e.g. Part 1)
       
**** Objective
     - extraction of synergies
       - from data sample without statistical regularities
       - without robot's analytical dynamics model
     - control utilizing synergies

**** Few research has been done

*** Methodology

**** a summary slide
***** Data generation
      - end effector starts from random positions
      - actuated by randomly parameterized control signals
	- no statistical regularities

***** System identification
      - estimate 

***** Data preprocessing for extraction of synergies

***** Controller

*** Results

*** Conclusion

*** Related publication
