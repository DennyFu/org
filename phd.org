Hosoda sensei's questions
why the cost-to-go value is not decreasing as the number of synergies increase


Because under the current setting of the cost-to-go function, the increase of the number of synergies does not chathe improvement of the cost-to-go function the solver for the optimal control problem The cost-to-go value is not strongly related to the number of synergies used in solving for the optimal control problems in this chapter. It also depends on the solver used and the definition of the cost-to-go function. The optimal control problems are solved by a solver called iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian iLQG. The solver stops iteration for obtaining better results if the change of the cost-to-go functions is very small. In the current result, using 4 synergies can reach to a target point closely. When using 5 or more synergies, the robot is expected to approach closer to the target. But the improvement reflected in the resulting cost-to-go value may be too small that the iLQG solver cannot detect the improvement and stop iteration. 

Arai's sensei's questions
Can you explain why 4 synergies is enough?
This is the problem of controlling the robot end effector on a 2D task space. As the synergy activations are constrained to nonnegative, actuating one synergies can only move the end effector in one direction. Therefore, conceptually, the robot needs minimally 4 synergies to move in all possible directions on the 2D task space.

Technical explanation of iLQG

Compare with no synergies case, which is the optimal case in our setting.







The total variance explained simply increases as the number of synergies increases

In this graph, as the number of synergies increases, the cost-to-go value does not decrease simply. Why?

i don't know in detail about how do you utilize the analytical model for getting synergies, but is the analytical model means that has some relation between the cost function 

i guess the reason why the cost-to-go function decrease with the number of synergies increases is that the way you get the synergies from the analytical model is completely different, completely away from the cost-to-go values,
means that the strategy to get the synergies is not really appropriate estimates how it is effective or not
= the cost-to-go value is not a appropriate value to estimate ...

it cannot be expected that the more synergies leads to the better results(previous question)

-ishiguro sensei: is it the matter of the task? the task was so simple? 

maybe the appropriate answer would be: the index how you can get the synergies is completely different from cost-to-go value,
you should think about the relation between how you can determine the number of  synergies and the cost-to-go function, i.e. the relation between these two.
If you expect some positive correlation between these two values, then the graph will be decreasing, now the current graph suggest these two variable are not strongly related. 

What kind of relation between the cost-to-go values and the index of how you can deterimine the synergies 

- ishiguro sensei: need to analyze the result and get some hypothesis why this reuslt happens


Arai sensei: what is the most important contribution?

** Hosoda sensei's questions
*** why the cost-to-go value is not decreasing as the number of synergies increases

The resulting cost-to-go values when using 4 or more synergies appeared to be the same level because these values are very closed to the reference value. In the current setting that the reaching task is achieved by solving the optimal control problem using the solver iLQG, the reference value is the cost-to-go value when the optimal control problem is solve in original dimensionality, i.e. the "no synergies" case. 


It is assumed that the iLQG solver can solve for the current optimal control problem of the reaching tasks accurately, such that the reference value is the best cost-to-go value among the cases when different number synergies is used. The iLQR (iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian) solver solve for locally-optimal feedback control of a nonlinear dynamics system given a quadratic cost-to-go function; It iteratively linearizes the nonlinear dynamics system around a nominal trajectory, and solve for a locally optimal feedback control law using a modified LQG 


The goal-related synergies are extracted from the optimal solutions, say A, solved in original dimensionality. When they are used to solve for the same optimal control problem, it is thereby expected that as the number of synergies used decreases, the resulting cost-to-go values increases. 

The gool-unrelated synergies are extracted from different dataset that are optimized b

The random synergies 

** Arai's sensei's questions
*** Can you explain why 4 synergies is enough?
Theoretically, 3 nonnegative synergies that are actuated by nonnegative synergy activation are enough to manipulate the current robot in chapter 3. A synergy specifies co-activations of all muscles. When a synergy is activated, all the muscles contribute to provide motion in one direction. Becasue theoretically the minimum number of vectors (bases) needed to span a 2D plane is 3, at least 3 synergies are required to produce motion in all possible directions on the 2D task space of the end effector.


My results shows that the current robot needs 4 synergies because of the following possible reasons:
- Using 4 synergies may produce motion with with smaller total control efforts, since the measure of total control efforts is included in the optimization index (the cost-to-go function).
- Nonnegative matrix fractionation (NMF) may not be able to extract 3 synergies that can produce motion in all possible direction, since NMF does not consider the resulting motion direction.
- 2 or more synergies are necessary to achieve motion in a certain direction with enough amplitude of accelerations.


*** How to determine the number of synergies? What is the best number of synergies? Have you consider to determine the number of synergies in other chapter?

Depending on the chapter, this thesis determines the number of synergies according to three criteria: different criteria, such as the control performance, the computation time and the total variance explained. 
In chapter 3, the number of synergies is determined according to the resulting cost-to-go values, the resulting computational time spent and the number of synergies used. Since 4 synergies was the minimum number that could achieve small enough cost-to-go value with less computation time, I would say using 4 synergies was the best choice.
In chapter 4, the number of synergies is determined according to the resulting tracking error, whether collisions to the joint limits occured and the number of synergies used. Since 5 synergies was the minimum number that could achieve small tracking error without collisions to the joint limits, I would say using 5 synergies was the best choice.
In chapter 5, in contrast to the chapter 3 and chapter 4 that determine the number of synergies after the act of control, the number of synergies is determined according to the total variance explained before the act of control. The number of synergies was determined such that the extracted synergies explained over 90% total variance of data. As a result, 4 or 5 synergies were used to carry out the exploration task.

Develop bio-inspired, data-driven based methods such that musculoskeletal robot can obtain muscle synergies to simplify control complexity and can perform precise manipulation by itself, without providing prior knowledge of the robot.



Musculoskeletal robots have biomimetic structure that can potentially behave like biological creatures.
It is desirable that musculoskeletal robots can perform a variety of tasks. For instance, precise manipulation is exhausting task for human; It is difficult to maintain high attention to maintain high accuracy for a long time. Musculoskeletal robots can replace human in jobs that requires precise manipulation and ability to perform different tasks.
If robot can learn control by itself, it can save many complicated setup procedures such as obtaining mathematical model of the robot, calibration, etc..
However, the complicated musculoskeletal structure posed difficulties in developing control methods.
The bio-inspired modular control concept is a possible approach to reduce control complexity arisen from high control dimensionality. Data-driven based control is promising approach to avoid mathematical modeling of complicated musculoskeletal structure.

**** "Why the cost-to-go value is not decreasing as the number of synergies increase?”

The cost-to-go value in my proposed method using synergies is expected to be worse than the reference value, i.e., the cost-to-go value of the "no synergies" case. Since the cost-to-go value of the “4 synergies” case is similar to the reference value, the value might not decrease significantly even if the number of synergies is larger than 4. Note that, even though the value does not decrease significantly, the value does not increase and it could be said that the values are monotonically decreasing when we consider all cases including “3 synergies”. The details are as explained below.
The robot motion is generated by a well-established “optimal control theory based solver” called iLQG, no matter how the synergies are used or not. The iLQG controls the robot so that the cost-to-go value is minimized, and it is assumed that the iLQG solver can determine the “optimal” control signal within the given control space. The control space using synergies becomes a low-dimensional “subspace” of the original control space, and the performance index of the control, i.e., the cost-to-go value, must degrade when the synergies are used. Therefore, the cost-to-go value of the “no synergy” case is treated as the reference value which is the lower limit of the performance index.
The simplicity of the task may affect the change of the performance index. The results show that “4 synergies” are enough to achieve the reaching tasks. If the task becomes more complicated, it is expected that the performance index may decrease as the number of synergies."

**** the minimum number of synergies required
“Can you explain why 4 synergies is enough?”
One synergy might move the end effector in one direction since the muscle just contract and at least 2 synergies may be necessary if we have to move the end effector in a 1-D space (on a line). In order to move the end effector in a 2D space, more synergies seem to be required as shown below figures.

From the figures, controlling the robot by 3 synergies may enable the reaching motion but our result shows that 4 synergies are necessary. One possible reason is the non-linearity of the robot dynamics. The moving direction by a synergy must depends on the posture of the robot, and it make sense that a redundant number of synergies are required to move the end effector to various target positions.


**** how we can select the best number of synergies
     “How to determine the number of synergies? What is the best number of synergies?”
The best number of synergies might be determined according to the performance index of the control and the calculation cost. While the performance might degrade as the number of synergies decreases, the calculation cost must be reduced. To develop a method to consider the balancing is one of the future work. In the Chapter 3, controlling with 3 synergies is significantly worse than that with 4 synergies. In such a case, controlling with 4 synergies seems to be the best case. Note that, it may depend on the control task.




*** in chapter 4
**** how we can select the best number of synergies? “Have you consider to determine the number of synergies in other chapters?”
Yes, in chapter 4, similar criterion can be used to determine the best number of synergies.

*** in chapter 5
**** how we can select the best number of synergies? “Have you consider to determine the number of synergies in other chapters?”
No, in chapter 5, there is no criterion to determine the best number of synergies, during the data collection. Therefore, I extract the synergies which explain 90% of the total variance where the value is determined empirically. Note that, it is not the way to determine the best number of synergies.


“What is the main contribution of the thesis?”
The main contribution of this thesis is the investigation of the feasibility of control methods utilizing muscle synergies for a musculoskeletal robot. Musculoskeletal robots have redundant number of joints and muscles that can perform a diversity of tasks. Dimensionality reduction is crucial to develop methods to effectively control the robots. My research can be the first step to the realization of robots that can work in daily life.

** Muscle synergies


How does the central nervous system (CNS) coordinate many muscles to produce movements and perform various motor tasks?
%
The is one of fundamental questions in the study of biological motor control.
%
Because of the redundancies of the joints and the muscles of musculoskeletal structure, there are inifinite number of ways can accomplish a motor task.
%
A motor task can be achieved by one of the many joint configurations, where each configurations can be attained one of the many combinations of muscle activations.
%
%This many degree-of-freedom body structure allows performing a task in many different ways thus enhance flexibility~\cite{latash2007toward}, however, also poses a problem in control of selecting a solution because the task requirement provided is insufficient~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
This poses a problem to the CNS, because the task requirement provided is insufficient to select one of the inifinite number of possible ways to accomplish the motor task~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
%
This problem is known as the degree-of-freedom problem or the Bernstein's problem~\{bernstein1967co}.
%
It has been suggested that the CNS resolves this control difficulty by simplifying control complexity by modularly organizing control variables~\cite{bernstein1967co,latash2007toward} such as spinal force field, kinematics strokes and muscle synergies~\cite{flash:2005}.
%

Muscle synergies specifies co-activations of a group of muscles~\cite{tresch2009case}.
%
By coordinating muscle synergies, the CNS produces a movement with fewer control variables; the CNS dose not control many muscles independently~\cite{lee1984neuromotor, d2003combinations}.
%
...



(This section gives a brief introduction about how muscle synergies can simply control complexity. 
%
Interpretations of muscle synergies are also mentioned.)






*** Interpretations of muscle synergies

Muscle synergies are quantitatively studied by investigating statistical regularities in measurements of muscle activations.
%
In biological studies, the measurements are usually electromyogram (EMG) signals of motor tasks performed by a variety of species~\cite{yakovenko2011sequential, overduin2008modulation}.
%
Two components, muscle synergies and muscle synergy activations, are extracted from a given data sample of muscle activations.
% 
Common analysis assumes that a given data sample can be approximated by linear combination of a set of muscle synergies.
%
For the purpose of dimensionality reduction, it usually seeks for a set of syneriges where the number of synergies is smaller than the number of muscles.
%
The muscle activations are usually low-dimensional signals scaling the corresponding muscle synergies. 
%
Interpretations of the muscle synergies depends on the purposes and requirements of analysis.
%

There are two main interpretations of muscle synergies, namely the time-invariant synergy and time varying synergies.
%
In the time-invariant synergies interpretation, each muscle synergy specifies a fixed pattern of muscle co-activations of a group of muscles. 
%
Time-invariant are constant for all the time; they store spatio information of muscles and are task-independent~\cite{alessandro2013muscle}.
%
Time-invariant synergies can be extracted by common linear matrix factorization tools. 
%
For instance, if principal component analysis (PCA) is used, the principal components are the time-invariant muscle synergies, and the corresponding scores are the synergy activations.

In the time-varying synergies interpretation, each muscle synergy specifies a sequence of muscle activations spanning for a particular duration of a group of muscles. 
%
Therefore, a synergy can be an input signal for actuation; they contains spatiotemporal information.
%
The synergy activation defines the scale, time-lead/lag, and duration of a synergy. 
%
The activations for a group of muscles are given by superposing time-varying synergies after modification by synergy activations.
%
The activations can be either time-invariant or time-varying; 
This provide flexibility to adapt inherent regularities in data sample to provide better dimensionality reduction performance.
%
The extraction of time-varying synergies needs more complicated tools such as optimization process with specific constraints as demonstrated in~\cite{d2003combinations}.


Apart from the concept of muscles synergies, there is another interpretation of modular control mechanism in the central nervous system called the "uncontrolled manifold"~\cite{latash2002motor}, which states that the central nervous system coordinates elements (e.g. joint, muscles) that only control task-related elements and leave others uncontrolled. 
%
Across trails the variance of all the elements form a task-dependent uncontrolled manifold. 
%
However, this concept requires a controller acts in high-dimensional space~\cite{latash2010motor} (because all elements are controlled), which is different from the notion of control simplification in this study.


*** Biological evidence

Biological studies focus on validating the hypothesis of muscle synergies.
%
One common approach is to obtain EMG signals from specific motor tasks of a certain species, followed by investigating the inherent statistical regularities;
%
It is to identify muscle synergies and synergy activations that have lower dimensionality than the original number of muscles to approximate the acquired data sample.
% 
%Given a set of muscle synergies, the control complexity is reduced if the control dimensionality, which is equivalent to the dimensionality of the muscle synergy activations, is smaller than the original control dimensionality, which equals the number muscles.
Such analysis supports the muscle synergy hypothesis.

To testify the muscle synergy hypothesis, various experiments have been carried out in a variety of species.
%
In analyses of frog hindlimb movements such as reflexive motion~\cite{tresch:1999}, kicking~\cite{d2003combinations}, swimming, jumping, and walking~\cite{d'Avella:2005}, it has been reported that both the identified time-varying synergies~\cite{d2003combinations} and time-invariant synergies~\cite{tresch:1999} were directly related to the resulting kinematics characteristics.
%
Further evidence was found in cat postural experiments~\cite{ting2005limited,torres2006muscle}, where the time-invariant synergies obtained from the EMG signals from a set of natural postural configurations to maintain balance on a translating surface were consistent with that on a rotating surfance, suggesting that the synergies captured specific biomechanical functionalities.
%
In primates experiments, it was discovered that small number of time-invariant synergies~\cite{brochier2004patterns} extracted from a grasping task were able to reconstruct the to reconstruct the EMG signals measured in other trials of the same task. Small number of time-varying synergies were also capable to account for a variety of grasping tasks, and adaptive to describe novel motor behavior by tuning the scale and timing in the synergies~\cite{overduin2008modulation}.

The hypothesis of muscle synergies was also verified in human motor tasks.
%
The EMG-signals of reaching tasks in different speeds and directions could be approximated by linear combinations of extracted synergies; Similar synergies were found across subjects and with and without loading conditions~\cite{d2006control,d'avella:2008}. 
%
Similar finding was reported in~\cite{roh2012robustness}, where a small number of time-invariant synergies could explain the muscle activations in producing isometric forces by hand; The extracted synergies were corelated to a particular force direction that the synergy activations account for the amplitude of force.
%
It has been also demonstrated that walking motions with different speeds and loading conditions could be explained by small number of time-varying synergies, which were found correlated to the kinematics of foot~\cite{ivanenko2003temporal,ivanenko2004five}


Not all experiments supports the muscle synergy hypothesis.
In an experiment of producing finger-tip force, it was found that the variance explained by each extracted synergies (by PCA) from the measured EMG signals has nonnegligible fluctuation within trials, which was in conflict with the hypothesis that muscle activations are formed by small number of muscle synergies.~\cite{valero2009structured}
%
It has been also argued that the identified muscle synergies from EMG signals may be the consequence of task or biomechanical constraints, unrelated to the neural coupling of muscles in the CNS~\cite{kutch2012challenges}, although these results did not falsify the existence of neural implementationf of muscle synergies in the CNS.

% direct evidence
More direct approach for testification of muscle synergy hypothesis has been conducted by trying to locate the neural implementation of muscle synergies in the CNS (e.g. motor cortex) when performing different motor tasks.
%
Supportive evidence of muslce synergies has been found in cat that the sequential activations of specific groups of muscles were initialized and tuned by populations of neurons in the motor cortex~\cite{yakovenko2011sequential}.
%
Similar findings were reported in the study of the relationship between the neural activities in monkey's brain and muscle activations during pointing and reaching movements , where activations of groups of muscles that related to particular functionalities were correlated to the discharge of individual neurons in the primary motor cortex~\cite{holdefer2002primary}.
%
It was found that the time-invariant synergies extracted from the EMG signals resuting from micro-stimulations of particular regions in the motor cortex of two rhesus macaques were very similar to those identified from the reaching and grasping motions of the other rhesus macaques.
%
In comparing time-invariant synergies extracted from the arm movements performed by healthy and that performed by brain-damaged patients, it was found that they are very similar, implying that the synergies were implemented in the unimpaired regions in the CNS~\cite{cheung2009stability}.
%
In extension of the comparison to patients with more severe brain-damaged, the time-invariant synergies were found to be varied in the forms of preservations, merging and fractionation, indicating the CNS may response to the cortial damage~\cite{cheung2012muscle}. Similar finding of preservation of synergy activations after stroke has also been reported in~\cite{gizzi2011impulses}. 


The limitation of analysis of measured EMG signals is that it is difficult to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing the extracted synergies to perform the observed motor tasks or generalized motor tasks.
%
The validation of the modular control is usally carried out by reconstructing the observed data sample by smaller number of muscle synergies as bases; However, 
the reconstructed muscle activities may not produce the same observed task~\cite{broer2010dynamical}.
%
Verifications using biologically plausible musculoskeletal model have been adopted to overcome this deficiency.
%
A mathematical model of frog hindlimb was used in~\cite{berniker:2009} in a synergies-based control scheme. It was shown that a low-dimensional dynamical model capture the natural dynamics of the frog hindlimb. Time-invariant synergies were obtained from data sample that was representative to account for both the low- and full-dimensional dynamics with minimum muscular effort. The synergies were found very similar to the synergies extracted from jumping and swimming motions of intact frogs. And control performance of the low-dimensional control scheme using the proposed synergies was comparable with the full-dimensional controller that activated each muscle independently.
%
Analysis was also conducted for human walking motion. 
%
It was reported that the time-invariant synergies extracted from the EMG signals of walking could be used as bases to reproduce walking kinematics and the ground reaction forces via a musculoskeletal model of human legs~\cite{neptune2009modular;allen2012three}, where the relative muscle activations and the synergy activations  were optimized such that the difference between the experimental measurements and the forward simulation was minimized. 



*** Relation to biological motor control (Computational aspects of control from biological perspective)

%Introduce control strategies in vertebrates and its relationship (optimal and Task-oriented) to muscle synergies
%Where do muscle synergies originate from? How are they organized?
%
In addition to testify the existence of muscle synergies, the relationship between muscle synergies and the act of control has been studied. 
%
In the presented literature above, synergies were extracted from muscle activations of motor tasks, which are the consequence of the act of control by the CNS.
%
%Although muscle synergies may not be encoded in the CNS, they may be just the outcomes induced by task or biomechanical constraints~\cite{kutch2012challenges}, it is still difficult to 
This indicates there is strong relationship between the existence of muscle synergies and the control strategies adopted in the CNS.
%
Here two control strategies, task-oriented control strategy and optimal control strategy, that closely related to muscle synergies are introduced. 


**** Task-oriented control strategy
% task-coordinate or Kinematics coordinate
Task-oriented control strategy refers to the concept that the CNS focuses on achieving better control accuracy in terms of the task-space coordinates such as position of a finger tip, rather than focus on joint-space coordinates such as angles of shoulder, elbow and wrist~\cite{atkeson1985kinematic}. 
%
The CNS represents limb (joint space) and target (task space) in different coordinates frames, and carries out transformation between the reference coordinates frame during execution of a movement~\cite{snyder2000coordinate}. 
%
A question about which coordinate frame (e.g. task-space coordinate frame which represents positions, a finger, or joint-space coordinate frame which represents angles of a shoulder, elbow and wrist of an arm) is used in the CNS during movement generation, has been posed in several literature~\cite{lacquaniti1989central, henis1995mechanisms}. 
%
This concept has been investigated by experimental measurements of variance during movements (e.g. reaching movement), because exerting control reduces error and thus the reference frame that revealed smaller variance would be more likely the central nervous system used in movement generation~\cite{andersen1985encoding}. 
%
Several experimental studies also reported that variance in the task-space were smaller than the variance in joint space, either in both human~\cite{haggard1995patterns} and animals~\cite{martin1995kinematic}; 
%
This implies more attention is paid on controlling the task space variables that the joint space variables.

Analyses have related muscle synergies with task-related variables to the performance of task.
%
In~\cite{d2008modulation}, it was demonstrated that the EMG-signals of human reaching movements in different directions and speeds could be represented by small number of time-varying synergies during the reaching movements and time-invariant synergies at the end of the reachings (to maintain posture); The time-varying synergies were modulated in terms of the directions and speeds, implying that the task-relevant sensory information and the dynamics of the system could be incorporated into low-dimensional representation in the form of synergies to simply control.
%
The functionality of muscle synergies in human postural task was analyzed in~\cite{chvatal2011common}. In addition to the EMG signals of a person standing on a surface under perturbation, the task-related variable, measured reaction forces to the feet and the accelerations of the center of mass of the body, were included in the data sample for extraction of the so-called functional muscle synergies (time-invariant). It was found that the functional synergies extracted from one type of responses to the perturbations (non-stepping responses) were similar and could be used to reconstruct the EMG signals and the task-related variables of another type of reponses (stepping responses), supporting that the concept that muscle synergies are to produce a predictable biomechanical function~\cite{ting2005limited}.



**** Optimal control strategy
It has been suggested that the CNS produce movements optimally -- It selects an optimal control signals from the inifinite number of solutions according to certain optimal principle in performing a motor task.
%
As mentioned previously, the CNS has to select one of the possible solutions (combination of control signals) in producing movement to perform specific tasks.
%
In computational study of motor control, an optimality principle, the minimum intervention principle~\cite{todorov2004optimality, todorov2005task}, has been proposed to relate the act of task-oriented control and the resulting regularities in the control signals (e.g. EMG signals). 
%
It states that the optimization during  generation of voluntary movements focuses on task-related control variables (e.g. specific groups of muscles that produce reaching motion in desired directions) and leaves task-unrelated control variables uncontrolled, which is related to the concept of uncontrolled manifold~\cite{latash2002motor, latash2007toward}.
%
Using a optimal control theory to solve for solutions of a motor task~\cite{todorov:2002,todorov:2005,chhabra2006properties}, it has been demonstrated that a low-dimensional control space that reflects task-relevant dynamics of system is naturally identified~\cite{tresch2009case}. 
%
Related results have been reported in~\cite{mckay2008functional,mckay2012optimization}. Based on an anatomically-realistic musculoskeletal model of cat, the muscle activations for 
keeping balance on a surface under translational perturbations were found by optimization that constraints center of mass forces and moments (task-related variables) while minimizing control efforts. It was found that the extracted time-invariant synergies could predict the EMG signals and the reaction forces on the surface observed experimentally, suggesting that muscle synergies mechanism can reduce control dimensionality and can achieve similar kinetics to the optimal solution.





** Applications of muscle synergies in robotics

%indicate the engineering purpose is different from biological studies that to find synergies to perform different task 

The modular control based on muscle synergies motivates robotic research to develop synergetic control strategies to reduce control complexity (in the sense of reducing the number of control variable) high dimensional robotic systems.
%
In contrast to biological studies that the objective is to justify (or falsify) the muscle synergies hypothesis, the objective in engineering is to develop controllers for accomplishment of a variety of tasks. 
%
This section highlights several robotic researches that adopt the concept of muscle synergies.





%Applications using time-invariant and time-varying synergies
One of the first synergies-based controllers was proposed in~\cite{mussa1997nonlinear}. 
The control signals of the actuators were given by linear combination of time-varying synergies. 
%
Each synergy was defined by a single equilibrium point. 
%
This idea was inspired from similar proposal in biological studies~\cite{bizzi1984posture,hogan1984organizing} that the CNS plans and executes limb movement as a temporal sequence of static attractor points for the limb. 
%
Various end effector trajectories of a simulated planar kinematic chain could be produced by suitable choice of equilibrium points.
Based on the same synthesis of synergies, a feedback controller that was able to drive a simulated 2D planar kinematic chain to synergy equilibrium position to follow the desired trajectory was proposed in~\cite{nori2005control}; The synergies were obtained from analytical solution of an optimal control problem.

Obtaining muscle synergies from solutions of optimization problems can be found in~\cite{chhabra:2006,todorov2009compositionality}
In~\cite{chhabra:2006}, analysis was carried out on a simulated planar robotic arm. Two sets of time-varying synergies extracted from optimal solutions of reaching tasks and via-point tasks solved by optimal control theory. Comparison of the two sets of synergies revealed that some synergies in the two sets were similar, suggesting that synergies arise regardless of the task context; implying optimal motor behaviors can be efficiently generated by combinations of task-dependent and task-independent synergies.
The existence of such compositional optimal control laws has been proven mathematically in~\cite{todorov2009compositionality}; For a certain class of stochastic optimal control problems that have a particular form of cost-to-go function in defining a task, an optimal control law that is a linear combination of some functions. These functions are the solutions of other optimal control problems and can be represented as time-varying synergies (or primitives), although the acquisition of such time-varying synergies is not provided.

% - here present works without analytical model
The acquistion of time-varying synergies without given accurate system dynamics model has been demonstrated in~\cite{todorov2003unsupervised}.
%
In the proposed hierarchical control scheme, muscle synergies translate high-level control signals encoded in low-dimensionality to actual muscle activations, via some internal variables that receive sensory signals; There exists inverse model that maps the sensory signals to the muscle synergies. 
The inverse model as well as the time-varying synergies can be learned from observed data sample, and form a low-dimensional controller.
However, whether the controller can perform generalized tasks have not yet been testified.
Reinforcement learning solves optimal control problem adaptively without given system dynamics~\cite{sutton1992reinforcement,sutton1998reinforcement}. Under the reinforcement learning framework, a composite control law is defined as linear combination of time-varying synergies; Each synergy is a parameterized control policy. A given task is achieved by solving an associated Markov decision process to determine optimal parameters in the composite control law that maximize the expected reward.
It was shown that the introduction of time-varying synergies faciliate learning novel control policies, in a scenario that required a simulated muscle-actuated planar robot to complete reaching tasks in the present of obstacles.

One advantage of time-invariant synergies is that they are simpler. Comparing with time-varying synergies, it enables easier implementation of existing feedback control techniques, since time-invariant synergies encode fixed muscle co-activations (spatio information) that a low-dimensional controller generates synergy activations. Although encoding temporal information in the time-varying synergies provides good dimensionality reduction performance, it also introduce difficulties in implementation of feedback controller~\cite{alessandro2013muscle}.

% from here time-invariant synergies
Taking the advantage of simplicity, feedback controllers based on time-invariant synergies have been implemented in several robotic researches. 
In the development of the tendon-driven robotic ACT hand~\cite{malhotra2012reduced}, time-invariant synergies were adopted in a PID feedback controller that controls a finger-tip to follow a circular trajectories on a virtual plane accurately. In addition to the use of muscle synergies to reduce control dimensionality, the sensory signals were adopted to reduce the observation space, leading to a low-dimensional dynamical system where the feedback controller was derived.
Without the knowledge of robot dynamics, an learning-based control scheme has been proposed in~\cite{marques2012unsupervised} to obtain muscle synergies using unsupervised Hebbian-like algorithm and to learn a low-dimensional feedforward controller based on supervised learning techniques; 
In the experiment of a single-joint robot driven by four tendons connected to independent motors, the time-invariant muscle synergies were obtained from data sample of robot responses of spontaneous single muscle twitches with fixed amplitude and duration. The low-dimensional controller was learned to minimize task error. In contrast to most literature where synergies have been obtained from data sample of movements with specific task goals, this work demonstrates that time-invariant synergies can also be obtained from data sample that is not generated with specific task goals. 


% conclude that obtain time-invariant synergies without analytical model of musculoskeletal robots is somewhat a missing part in robotics research.
To conclude, 
- As a final note, it is important to say that the concept of modularity has been employed in robot control in many other ways. In most of these works modules are defined as kinematic-based controllers that are combined sequentially to obtain complex joint trajectories (Khansari-Zadeh and Billard, 2011; Ijspeert et al., 2013). In this regard, these works are more related to the concept of kinematic stroke than to muscle synergies (Pollick et al., 2009). 











*** (Internal models, distributes to learning-based control applications)
- Muscle synergies may then provide the basis functions that allow acquiring and using such mapping quickly and efficiently by reducing the number of parameters to be adjusted, stored, and retrieved. 
- We propose that an internal model for postural force generation may coordinate functional muscle synergies that are invariant in intrinsic limb coordinates, and this reduced-dimension control scheme reduces the set of forces available for postural control.( J. Lucas McKay, Lena H. Ting 2008 J. biomechanics)
- An internal representation of the point-to-point movement corresponding to the desired corrective movement in terms of a few synergy recruitment parameters may simplify the online computation of the necessary adjustments.{d2011superposition}

** Research focuses
This thesis put focuses on the extraction and utilization of time-invariant synergies.
%
The objectives of robotic researches should focus on developing control methods that allow robotic systems to achieve a variety of tasks.
%
Adopting task-independent time-invariant synergies is a straightforward approach, also because they are simpler to extract, and allow implementation of existing feedback control methods.  
%
Although time-varying synergies are more flexible that may enhance dimensionality reduction performance for specific data regularities, they require more complicated methods for extraction and control. 
%
In particular, the following objectives are concerned:
- obj 1
- obj 2
- obj 3



(%
In many robotic researches, as well as biological studies, synergies are extracted from data samples that exploit prior information about desired task goals;
%
Employing such synergies that inherently possess task-relevant information 


as mention, TI synergies has been extracted from data sample of movements with specific task goals. synergies extracted from such data sample inherently possess task-related properties. using such task-related synergies for develpping control method for a variety or generalized task is indirect. 
A more direct approach would be extractig synrgies from task-irrrlecvant data sample and theris utilization. 


How to obtain muscle synergies?

robotic research focus on developing controller that can achieve a variety of task,
the task-independent properties seems more sutiable for this objective. 
although it has been show that time-varying synergies are capable of performing generalized task as demonstrated in todorov's composite optimal contrl law, time-varying synergies controller are usally more complicated, and it more difficult to implement feedback controller. 
TI are studied in this thesis.)
