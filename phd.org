** Muscle synergies


How does the central nervous system (CNS) coordinate many muscles to produce movements and perform various motor tasks?
%
The is one of fundamental questions in the study of biological motor control.
%
Because of the redundancies of the joints and the muscles of musculoskeletal structure, there are inifinite number of ways can accomplish a motor task.
%
A motor task can be achieved by one of the many joint configurations, where each configurations can be attained one of the many combinations of muscle activations.
%
%This many degree-of-freedom body structure allows performing a task in many different ways thus enhance flexibility~\cite{latash2007toward}, however, also poses a problem in control of selecting a solution because the task requirement provided is insufficient~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
This poses a problem to the CNS, because the task requirement provided is insufficient to select one of the inifinite number of possible ways to accomplish the motor task~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
%
This problem is known as the degree-of-freedom problem or the Bernstein's problem~\{bernstein1967co}.
%
It has been suggested that the CNS resolves this control difficulty by simplifying control complexity by modularly organizing control variables~\cite{bernstein1967co,latash2007toward} such as spinal force field, kinematics strokes and muscle synergies~\cite{flash:2005}.
%

Muscle synergies specifies co-activations of a group of muscles~\cite{tresch2009case}.
%
By coordinating muscle synergies, the CNS produces a movement with fewer control variables; the CNS dose not control many muscles independently~\cite{lee1984neuromotor, d2003combinations}.
%
...



(This section gives a brief introduction about how muscle synergies can simply control complexity. 
%
Interpretations of muscle synergies are also mentioned.)






*** Interpretations of muscle synergies

Muscle synergies are quantitatively studied by investigating statistical regularities in measurements of muscle activations.
%
In biological studies, the measurements are usually electromyogram (EMG) signals of motor tasks performed by a variety of species~\cite{yakovenko2011sequential, overduin2008modulation}.
%
Two components, muscle synergies and muscle synergy activations, are extracted from a given data sample of muscle activations.
% 
Muscle synergy activations scale corresponding muscle synergies. They are usually low-dimensional signals.
%
Interpretations of the muscle synergies depends on the purposes and requirements of analysis.

There are two main interpretations of muscle synergies, namely the time-invariant synergy and time varying synergies.
%
In time-invariant synergies, 
time-invariant synergies
- nature
- extraction metod

In time-varying synergies,

time-varying synergies
- Nature
- extraction mehtod


Apart from the concept of muscles synergies, there is another interpretation of modular control mechanism in the central nervous system called the "uncontrolled manifold"~\cite{latash2002motor}, which states that the central nervous system coordinates elements (e.g. joint, muscles) that only control task-related elements and leave others uncontrolled. 
%
Across trails the variance of all the elements form a task-dependent uncontrolled manifold. 
%
However, this concept requires a controller acts in high-dimensional space~\cite{latash2010motor} (because all elements are controlled), which is different from the notion of control simplification in this study.


*** Biological evidence

Biological studies focus on validating the hypothesis of muscle synergies.
%
One common approach is to obtain EMG signals from specific motor tasks of a certain species, followed by investigating the inherent statistical regularities;
%
It is to identify muscle synergies and synergy activations that have lower dimensionality than the original number of muscles to approximate the acquired data sample.
% 
%Given a set of muscle synergies, the control complexity is reduced if the control dimensionality, which is equivalent to the dimensionality of the muscle synergy activations, is smaller than the original control dimensionality, which equals the number muscles.
Such analysis supports the muscle synergy hypothesis.

To testify the muscle synergy hypothesis, various experiments have been carried out in a variety of species.
%
In analyses of frog hindlimb movements such as reflexive motion~\cite{(Tresch et al.1999)}, kicking~\cite{(d'Avella et al., 2003)}, swimming, jumping, and walking~\cite{((d'Avella and Bizzi, 2005))}, it has been reported that both the identified time-varying synergies~\cite{(d'Avella et al., 2003)} and time-invariant synergies~\cite{(Tresch et al., 1999)} were directly related to the resulting kinematics characteristics.
%
Further evidence was found in cat postural experiments~\cite{ting's macpherson 2005, torres-oviedo 2006}, where the time-invariant synergies obtained from the EMG signals from a set of natural postural configurations to maintain balance on a translating surface were consistent with that on a rotating surfance, suggesting that the synergies captured specific biomechanical functionalities.
%
In primates experiments, it was discovered that small number of time-invariant synergies~\cite{Brochier et al. (2004) } extracted from a grasping task were able to reconstruct the to reconstruct the EMG signals measured in other trials of the same task. Small number of time-varying synergies were also capable to account for a variety of grasping tasks, and adaptive to describe novel motor behavior by tuning the scale and timing in the synergies~\cite{Overduin et al. (2008)}.

The hypothesis of muscle synergies was also verified in human motor tasks.
%
The EMG-signals of reaching tasks in different speeds and directions could be approximated by linear combinations of extracted synergies; Similar synergies were found across subjects and with and without loading conditions~\cite{ (d'Avella et al., 2006) (d'Avella et al., 2008)}. 
%
Similar finding was reported in ~\cite{roh2012}, where a small number of time-invariant synergies could explain the muscle activations in producing isometric forces by hand; The extracted synergies were corelated to a particular force direction that the synergy activations account for the amplitude of force.
%
It has been also demonstrated that walking motions with different speeds and loading conditions could be explained by small number of time-varying synergies, which were found correlated to the kinematics of foot~\cite{IvanenkoIvanenko et al. (2003,2004) }


Not all experiments supports the muscle synergy hypothesis.
In an experiment of producing finger-tip force, it was found that the variance explained by each extracted synergies (by PCA) from the measured EMG signals has nonnegligible fluctuation within trials, which was in conflict with the hypothesis that muscle activations are formed by small number of muscle synergies.~\cite{valero2009structured}
%
It has been also argued that the identified muscle synergies from EMG signals may be the consequence of task or biomechanical constraints, unrelated to the neural coupling of muscles in the CNS~/cite{kutch2012challenges}, although these results did not falsify the existence of neural implementationf of muscle synergies in the CNS.

% direct evidence
More direct approach for testification of muscle synergy hypothesis has been conducted by trying to locate the neural implementation of muscle synergies in the CNS (e.g. motor cortex) when performing different motor tasks.
%
Supportive evidence of muslce synergies has been found in cat that the sequential activations of specific groups of muscles were initialized and tuned by populations of neurons in the motor cortex~\cite{Yakovenko etal 2010}.
%
Similar findings were reported in the study of the relationship between the neural activities in monkey's brain and muscle activations during pointing and reaching movements , where activations of groups of muscles that related to particular functionalities were correlated to the discharge of individual neurons in the primary motor cortex~\cite{Holdefer and Miller (2002) }.
%
It was found that the time-invariant synergies extracted from the EMG signals resuting from micro-stimulations of particular regions in the motor cortex of two rhesus macaques were very similar to those identified from the reaching and grasping motions of the other rhesus macaques.
%
In comparing time-invariant synergies extracted from the arm movements performed by healthy and that performed by brain-damaged patients, it was found that they are very similar, implying that the synergies were implemented in the unimpaired regions in the CNS~\cite{Cheung et al. (2009b) }.
%
In extension of the comparison to patients with more severe brain-damaged, the time-invariant synergies were found to be varied in the forms of preservations, merging and fractionation, indicating the CNS may response to the cortial damage~\cite{(Cheung et al., 2012)}. Similar finding of preservation of synergy activations after stroke has also been reported in~\cite{Gizzi et al. (2011)}. 


The limitation of analysis of measured EMG signals is that it is difficult to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing the extracted synergies to perform the observed motor tasks or generalized motor tasks.
%
The validation of the modular control is usally carried out by reconstructing the observed data sample by smaller number of muscle synergies as bases; However, 
the reconstructed muscle activities may not produce the same observed task. (Broer and Takens, 2011).
%
Verifications using biologically plausible musculoskeletal model have been adopted to overcome this deficiency.
%
A mathematical model of frog hindlimb was used in~\cite{Berniker2009} in a synergies-based control scheme. It was shown that a low-dimensional dynamical model capture the natural dynamics of the frog hindlimb. Time-invariant synergies were obtained from data sample that was representative to account for both the low- and full-dimensional dynamics with minimum muscular effort. The synergies were found very similar to the synergies extracted from jumping and swimming motions of intact frogs. And control performance of the low-dimensional control scheme using the proposed synergies was comparable with the full-dimensional controller that activated each muscle independently.
%
Analysis was also conducted for human walking motion. 
%
It was reported that the time-invariant synergies extracted from the EMG signals of walking could be used as bases to reproduce walking kinematics and the ground reaction forces via a musculoskeletal model of human legs~\cite{Neptune et al., 2009; Allen and Neptune, 2012}, where the relative muscle activations and the synergy activations  were optimized such that the difference between the experimental measurements and the forward simulation was minimized. 



*** Relation to biological motor control (Computational aspects of control from biological perspective)

%Introduce control strategies in vertebrates and its relationship (optimal and Task-oriented) to muscle synergies
%Where do muscle synergies originate from? How are they organized?
%
In addition to testify the existence of muscle synergies, the relationship between muscle synergies and the act of control has been studied. 
%
In the presented literature above, synergies were extracted from muscle activations of motor tasks, which are the consequence of the act of control by the CNS.
%
%Although muscle synergies may not be encoded in the CNS, they may be just the outcomes induced by task or biomechanical constraints~/cite{kutch2012challenges}, it is still difficult to 
This indicates there is strong relationship between the existence of muscle synergies and the control strategies adopted in the CNS.
%
Here two control strategies, task-oriented control strategy and optimal control strategy, that closely related to muscle synergies are introduced. 


**** Task-oriented control strategy
% task-coordinate or Kinematics coordinate
Task-oriented control strategy refers to the concept that the CNS focuses on achieving better control accuracy in terms of the task-space coordinates such as position of a finger tip, rather than focus on joint-space coordinates such as angles of shoulder, elbow and wrist~\cite{atkeson1985kinematic}. 
%
The CNS represents limb (joint space) and target (task space) in different coordinates frames, and carries out transformation between the reference coordinates frame during execution of a movement~\cite{snyder2000coordinate}. 
%
A question about which coordinate frame (e.g. task-space coordinate frame which represents positions, a finger, or joint-space coordinate frame which represents angles of a shoulder, elbow and wrist of an arm) is used in the CNS during movement generation, has been posed in several literature~\cite{lacquaniti1989central, henis1995mechanisms}. 
%
This concept has been investigated by experimental measurements of variance during movements (e.g. reaching movement), because exerting control reduces error and thus the reference frame that revealed smaller variance would be more likely the central nervous system used in movement generation~\cite{andersen1985encoding}. 
%
Several experimental studies also reported that variance in the task-space were smaller than the variance in joint space, either in both human~\cite{haggard1995patterns} and animals~\cite{martin1995kinematic}; 
%
This implies more attention is paid on controlling the task space variables that the joint space variables.

Analyses have related muscle synergies with task-related variables to the performance of task.
%
In~\cite{(d'Avella 2008)}, it was demonstrated that the EMG-signals of human reaching movements in different directions and speeds could be represented by small number of time-varying synergies during the reaching movements and time-invariant synergies at the end of the reachings (to maintain posture); The time-varying synergies were modulated in terms of the directions and speeds, implying that the task-relevant sensory information and the dynamics of the system could be incorporated into low-dimensional representation in the form of synergies to simply control.
%
The functionality of muscle synergies in human postural task was analyzed in~\cite{chvatal et al.2011}. In addition to the EMG signals of a person standing on a surface under perturbation, the task-related variable, measured reaction forces to the feet and the accelerations of the center of mass of the body, were included in the data sample for extraction of the so-called functional muscle synergies (time-invariant). It was found that the functional synergies extracted from one type of responses to the perturbations (non-stepping responses) were similar and could be used to reconstruct the EMG signals and the task-related variables of another type of reponses (stepping responses), supporting that the concept that muscle synergies are to produce a predictable biomechanical function~\cite{ting_mckay2007}.



**** Optimal control strategy
It has been suggested that the CNS produce movements optimally -- It selects an optimal control signals from the inifinite number of solutions according to certain optimal principle in performing a motor task.
%
As mentioned previously, the CNS has to select one of the possible solutions (combination of control signals) in producing movement to perform specific tasks.
%
In computational study of motor control, an optimality principle, the minimum intervention principle~\cite{todorov2004optimality, todorov2005task}, has been proposed to relate the act of task-oriented control and the resulting regularities in the control signals (e.g. EMG signals). 
%
It states that the optimization during  generation of voluntary movements focuses on task-related control variables (e.g. specific groups of muscles that produce reaching motion in desired directions) and leaves task-unrelated control variables uncontrolled, which is related to the concept of uncontrolled manifold~\cite{latash2002motor, latash2007toward}.
%
Using a optimal control theory to solve for solutions of a motor task~\cite{todorov:2002,todorov:2005,chhabra2006properties}, it has been demonstrated that a low-dimensional control space that reflects task-relevant dynamics of system is naturally identified~\cite{tresch2009case}. 
%
Related results have been reported in~\cite{McKay and Ting (2008, 2012)}. Based on an anatomically-realistic musculoskeletal model of cat, the muscle activations for 
keeping balance on a surface under translational perturbations were found by optimization that constraints center of mass forces and moments (task-related variables) while minimizing control efforts. It was found that the extracted time-invariant synergies could predict the EMG signals and the reaction forces on the surface observed experimentally, suggesting that muscle synergies mechanism can reduce control dimensionality and can achieve similar kinetics to the optimal solution.





** Applications of muscle synergies in robotics

%indicate the engineering purpose is different from biological studies that to find synergies to perform different task 

The modular control based on muscle synergies motivates robotic research to develop synergetic control strategies to reduce control complexity (in the sense of reducing the number of control variable) high dimensional robotic systems.
%
In contrast to biological studies that the objective is to justify (or falsify) the muscle synergies hypothesis, the objective in engineering is to develop controllers for accomplishment of a variety of tasks. 
%
This section highlights several robotic researches that adopt the concept of muscle synergies.





%Applications using time-invariant and time-varying synergies
One of the first synergies-based controllers was proposed in \cite{Mussa-Ivaldi1997}. 
The control signals of the actuators were given by linear combination of time-varying synergies. 
%
Each synergy was defined by a single equilibrium point. 
%
This idea was inspired from similar proposal in biological studies~\cite{bizzi1984posture,hogan1984organizing} that the CNS plans and executes limb movement as a temporal sequence of static attractor points for the limb. 
%
Various end effector trajectories of a simulated planar kinematic chain could be produced by suitable choice of equilibrium points.
Based on the same synthesis of synergies, a feedback controller that was able to drive a simulated 2D planar kinematic chain to synergy equilibrium position to follow the desired trajectory was proposed in~\cite{Nori and Frezza, 2005}; The synergies were obtained from analytical solution of an optimal control problem.

Obtaining muscle synergies from solutions of optimization problems can be found in~\cite{chhabra:2006,todorov2009compositionality}
In~\cite{chhabra:2006}, analysis was carried out on a simulated planar robotic arm. Two sets of time-varying synergies extracted from optimal solutions of reaching tasks and via-point tasks solved by optimal control theory. Comparison of the two sets of synergies revealed that some synergies in the two sets were similar, suggesting that synergies arise regardless of the task context; implying optimal motor behaviors can be efficiently generated by combinations of task-dependent and task-independent synergies.
The existence of such compositional optimal control laws has been proven mathematically in~\cite{todorov2009compositionality}; For a certain class of stochastic optimal control problems that have a particular form of cost-to-go function in defining a task, an optimal control law that is a linear combination of some functions. These functions are the solutions of other optimal control problems and can be represented as time-varying synergies (or primitives), although the acquisition of such time-varying synergies is not provided.

% - here present works without analytical model
The acquistion of time-varying synergies without given accurate system dynamics model has been demonstrated in~\cite{Todorov and Ghahramani (2003)}.
%
In the proposed hierarchical control scheme, muscle synergies translate high-level control signals encoded in low-dimensionality to actual muscle activations, via some internal variables that receive sensory signals; There exists inverse model that maps the sensory signals to the muscle synergies. 
The inverse model as well as the time-varying synergies can be learned from observed data sample, and form a low-dimensional controller.
However, whether the controller can perform generalized tasks have not yet been testified.
Reinforcement learning solves optimal control problem adaptively without given system dynamics~\cite{sutton1992reinforcement,sutton1998reinforcement}. Under the reinforcement learning framework, a composite control law is defined as linear combination of time-varying synergies; Each synergy is a parameterized control policy. A given task is achieved by solving an associated Markov decision process to determine optimal parameters in the composite control law that maximize the expected reward.
It was shown that the introduction of time-varying synergies faciliate learning novel control policies, in a scenario that required a simulated muscle-actuated planar robot to complete reaching tasks in the present of obstacles.

One advantage of time-invariant synergies is that they are simpler. Comparing with time-varying synergies, it enables easier implementation of existing feedback control techniques, since time-invariant synergies encode fixed muscle co-activations (spatio information) that a low-dimensional controller generates synergy activations. Although encoding temporal information in the time-varying synergies provides good dimensionality reduction performance, it also introduce difficulties in implementation of feedback controller~\cite{alessandro2013muscle}.

% from here time-invariant synergies
Taking the advantage of simplicity, feedback controllers based on time-invariant synergies have been implemented in several robotic researches. 
In the development of the tendon-driven robotic ACT hand~\cite{malhotra2012reduced}, time-invariant synergies were adopted in a PID feedback controller that controls a finger-tip to follow a circular trajectories on a virtual plane accurately. In addition to the use of muscle synergies to reduce control dimensionality, the sensory signals were adopted to reduce the observation space, leading to a low-dimensional dynamical system where the feedback controller was derived.
Without the knowledge of robot dynamics, an learning-based control scheme has been proposed in~\cite{Marques et al. (2012)} to obtain muscle synergies using unsupervised Hebbian-like algorithm and to learn a low-dimensional feedforward controller based on supervised learning techniques; 
In the experiment of a single-joint robot driven by four tendons connected to independent motors, the time-invariant muscle synergies were obtained from data sample of robot responses of spontaneous single muscle twitches with fixed amplitude and duration. The low-dimensional controller was learned to minimize task error. In contrast to most literature where synergies have been obtained from data sample of movements with specific task goals, this work demonstrates that time-invariant synergies can also be obtained from data sample that is not generated with specific task goals. 


% conclude that obtain time-invariant synergies without analytical model of musculoskeletal robots is somewhat a missing part in robotics research.
- As a final note, it is important to say that the concept of modularity has been employed in robot control in many other ways. In most of these works modules are defined as kinematic-based controllers that are combined sequentially to obtain complex joint trajectories (Khansari-Zadeh and Billard, 2011; Ijspeert et al., 2013). In this regard, these works are more related to the concept of kinematic stroke than to muscle synergies (Pollick et al., 2009).
