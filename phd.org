** Muscle synergies


How does the central nervous system (CNS) coordinate many muscles to produce movements and perform various motor tasks?
%
The is one of fundamental questions in the study of biological motor control.
%
Because of the redundancies of the joints and the muscles of musculoskeletal structure, there are inifinite number of ways can accomplish a motor task.
%
A motor task can be achieved by one of the many joint configurations, where each configurations can be attained one of the many combinations of muscle activations.
%
%This many degree-of-freedom body structure allows performing a task in many different ways thus enhance flexibility~\cite{latash2007toward}, however, also poses a problem in control of selecting a solution because the task requirement provided is insufficient~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
This poses a problem to the CNS, because the task requirement provided is insufficient to select one of the inifinite number of possible ways to accomplish the motor task~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
%
This problem is known as the degree-of-freedom problem or the Bernstein's problem~\{bernstein1967co}.
%
It has been suggested that the CNS resolves this control difficulty by simplifying control complexity by modularly organizing control variables~\cite{bernstein1967co,latash2007toward} such as spinal force field, kinematics strokes and muscle synergies~\cite{flash:2005}.
%

Muscle synergies specifies co-activations of a group of muscles~\cite{tresch2009case}.
%
By coordinating muscle synergies, the CNS produces a movement with fewer control variables; the CNS dose not control many muscles independently~\cite{lee1984neuromotor, d2003combinations}.
%
...



(This section gives a brief introduction about how muscle synergies can simply control complexity. 
%
Interpretations of muscle synergies are also mentioned.)






*** Interpretations of muscle synergies

Muscle synergies are quantitatively studied by investigating statistical regularities in measurements of muscle activations.
%
In biological studies, the measurements are usually electromyogram (EMG) signals of motor tasks performed by a variety of species~\cite{yakovenko2011sequential, overduin2008modulation}.
%
Two components, muscle synergies and muscle synergy activations, are extracted from a given data sample of muscle activations.
% 
Muscle synergy activations scale corresponding muscle synergies. They are usually low-dimensional signals.
%
Interpretations of the muscle synergies depends on the purposes and requirements of analysis.

There are two main interpretations of muscle synergies, namely the time-invariant synergy and time varying synergies.
%
In time-invariant synergies, 
time-invariant synergies
- nature
- extraction metod

In time-varying synergies,

time-varying synergies
- Nature
- extraction mehtod


Apart from the concept of muscles synergies, there is another interpretation of modular control mechanism in the central nervous system called the "uncontrolled manifold"~\cite{latash2002motor}, which states that the central nervous system coordinates elements (e.g. joint, muscles) that only control task-related elements and leave others uncontrolled. 
%
Across trails the variance of all the elements form a task-dependent uncontrolled manifold. 
%
However, this concept requires a controller acts in high-dimensional space~\cite{latash2010motor} (because all elements are controlled), which is different from the notion of control simplification in this study.


*** Biological evidence

Biological studies focus on validating the hypothesis of muscle synergies.
%
One common approach is to obtain EMG signals from specific motor tasks of a certain species, followed by investigating the inherent statistical regularities;
%
It is to identify muscle synergies and synergy activations that have lower dimensionality than the original number of muscles to approximate the acquired data sample.
% 
%Given a set of muscle synergies, the control complexity is reduced if the control dimensionality, which is equivalent to the dimensionality of the muscle synergy activations, is smaller than the original control dimensionality, which equals the number muscles.
Such analysis supports the muscle synergy hypothesis.

To testify the muscle synergy hypothesis, various experiments have been carried out in a variety of species.
- A pioneering study showed that a small set of synchronous muscle synergies could generate a large number of reflexive motor patterns produced by cutaneous stimulations of the frog hindlimb (Tresch et al., 1999). This study also demonstrated that microstimulations of the spinal cord produced very similar muscle synergies to the ones generated by the freely moving animal. frog hindlimb Tresch1999, 
- The above analysis was then extended in order to identify spatiotemporal patterns of muscle activities (i.e., time-varying muscle synergies) (d'Avella et al., 2003). A few time-varying synergies were shown to underlie the muscle patterns required to let the frog kick in different directions, and their recruitment was directly related to movement kinematics. These findings were further generalized to a wide variety of frog natural motor behaviors such as jumping, swimming, and walking; evidence for both synchronous and time-varying synergies was reported (d'Avella and Bizzi, 2005).
- frog hindlimb d'avella 2003, frog natural motion d'avella and bizzi 2005, frog sensory feedback effect cheung 2005
- ting's macpherson 2005 cat, torres-oviedo 2006
- Brochier et al. (2004) provided further support for such a robust and distinctive synergistic organization of primates' muscle patterns during grasping. Analysis of single-trial EMG signals demonstrated that the time-varying activation of three synchronous synergies was reproducible across repetitions of the same grasping task and allowed unequivocal identification of the object grasped in each single trial. primate grasping brochier 2004, 
- A number of studies have examined the generalization of the above results to other species. In primates, Overduin et al. (2008) found that three time-varying synergies described a large repertoire of grasping tasks. Shape and size of the grasped objects were shown to modulate the recruitment strength as well as the timing of each synergy. In this way, this study validated that time-varying synergies account for salient task differences, and their activations can be tuned to adapt to novel behavioral contexts. primate grasping overduin 2008
- The framework of muscle synergies has been successful also in characterizing the spatio-temporal organization of muscle contractions during human reaching tasks. Muscle patterns observed during movements in different directions (d'Avella et al., 2006) and speed (d'Avella et al., 2008) were accurately reconstructed by appropriate linear combinations of synergies, which appeared very similar across subjects. The synergies that were extracted from muscle activities during unloaded reaching (i.e., subjects did not hold any load in their hands) accounted for the EMG signals obtained during loaded conditions. The recruitment of the individual synergies, as well as their onset time, were consistently modulated with movement direction, and did not change substantially with movement speed. human reaching d'avella 2006, 2008, 
- by Muceli et al. (2010); in this study a small set of specialized synchronous synergies was able to explain a large set of multijoint movements in various directions. muceli 2010, 
- Roh et al. (2012) showed that an appropriate set of synergies could reconstruct the average patterns of muscle activation observed during isometric forces production in humans. The EMG signals were obtained for different force magnitude, directions and initial postures. The extracted synergies were very similar across conditions, and they were able to explain the corresponding datasets. Each synergy seemed to underly a specific force direction, while its activation coefficient appeared correlated to the force magnitude. In another series of experiments, a small set of synchronous synergies was able to explain static hand postures and discriminate the shapes of grasped objects (Weiss and Flanders, 2004). Moreover, a few time-varying synergies succeeded in revealing the spatiotemporal patterns of muscle activity during hand shape transitions, as in fingerspelling (Klein Breteler et al., 2007). isometric force production roh2012
- A relevant series of experiments showed that muscle activations involved in human postural control can be explained in terms of combinations of muscle synergies. A set of synchronous muscle synergies was able to explain muscle activations involved in postural stabilization; the EMG variation observed among trials and perturbation directions was accounted for by appropriate modulations of the synergies activation coefficients (Torres-Oviedo and Ting, 2007).  ting's posture? torres-oviedo and ting 2007.
- human locomotion:  Ivanenko et al. (2004) showed that five temporal synergies could reconstruct the muscle activity involved in locomotion tasks. These patterns are robust across walking speeds and gravitational loads, and they relate to foot kinematics (Ivanenko et al., 2003). walking ivanenko 2003,2004,
- Similar results have been reported in other locomotor behaviors such as running (Cappellini et al., 2006) and pedaling (Hug et al., 2011). running cappellini 2006

Not all experiments supports the muscle synergy hypothesis.
In an experiment of producing finger-tip force, it was found that the variance explained by each extracted synergies (by PCA) from the measured EMG signals has nonnegligible fluctuation within trials, which opposes the hypothesis that muscle activations are formed by small number of muscle synergies.~\cite{valero2009structured}
%
It has been also argued that the identified muscle synergies from EMG signals may be the consequence of task or biomechanical constraints, unrelated to the neural coupling of muscles in the CNS~/cite{kutch2012challenges}.


More direct approach for testification of muscle synergy hypothesis has been conducted by trying to locate the neural implementation of muscle synergies in the CNS (e.g. motor cortex) when performing different motor tasks.
%
direct evidence
- Using such an approach, Holdefer and Miller (2002) provided direct support for the existence of neural substrates of muscle synergies in monkey's primary motor cortex. In particular, they studied the activity of neurons and muscles during the execution of a variety of reaching and pointing movements, and they found that the discharge of individual neurons represents the activation of functional groups of muscles.
- Another study demonstrated that the sequential activation of populations of neurons in the cat's motor cortex initiates and sequentially modifies the activity of a small number of functionally distinct groups of synergistic muscles (Yakovenko et al., 2010).
- Similarly, Overduin et al. (2012) showed that microstimulations of specific regions of the motor cortex of two rhesus macaques corresponded to well-defined spatial patterns of muscle activations. These synchronous synergies were very similar to those extracted from the same animals during natural reaching and grasping behaviors.
- In humans, the main approach to locate hypothetical muscle synergies has been to analyze brain-damaged patients. Comparing the synergies extracted from healthy and brain-damaged subjects could provide hints about the neural centers involved in the synergistic control of muscles. In this vein, examining motor tasks involving arm and hand movements, Cheung et al. (2009b) showed that the synchronous synergies extracted from the arm affected by a stroke were strikingly similar to the ones extracted from the unaffected arm, concluding that muscle synergies were located in regions of the CNS that were not damaged. In a second study involving subjects with more severe motor impairment (Cheung et al., 2012), they found that synchronous synergies may be modified according to three distinct patterns—including preservation, merging, and fractionation of muscle synergies—reflecting the multiple neural responses that occur after cortical damage. These patterns varied as a function of both the severity of functional impairment and the temporal distance from stroke onset.
- In contrast, Gizzi et al. (2011) demonstrated that the temporal waveforms of the synergy activation signals, but not the synchronous synergies, were preserved after stroke.



The limitation of analysis of measured EMG signals is that it is difficult to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing the extracted synergies to perform the observed motor tasks or novel motor tasks.
- relies on reconstructing the observed data sample by smaller number of muscle synergies as bases
- Since the musculoskeletal apparatus is a non-linear system, these approximations of the recorded muscle activities may not lead to the observed task performance (Broer and Takens, 2011; section 1.1), a condition that would harm the validity of the hypothesized modular control structure
- verification using  biologically plausible musculoskeletal model
- Berniker (2005) analyzed mathematically the control scheme of muscle synergies and proposed a principle for its formation (Berniker et al., 2009). A linear reduced-dimensional dynamical model that preserves (to the best extent possible) the natural dynamic of the original system is initially computed. Synergies are defined as the minimal set of input vectors that influence the output of the reduced-order model (Berniker, 2005), and that minimally restrict the commands (and the resulting responses) useful to solve the desired tasks (Berniker et al., 2009). Practically, this set is found by optimizing the synergy matrix over a representative dataset of desired sensory-motor signals. This method was able to synthesize a set of synergies for the model of the frog hindlimb that were very similar to the ones observed experimentally (Cheung et al., 2005). Furthermore, the synergy-based controller produced muscle activations and kinematic trajectories that were comparable with the ones obtained with the best-case controller (that can activate each muscle independently).
- A pool of studies investigate if a modular organization like the synchronous synergy model can explain a complex task like human walking (Neptune et al., 2009; McGowan et al., 2010; Allen and Neptune, 2012). A set of synergies are identified from a dataset of recorded EMG signals by means of NMF. Such “modules” are then used to generate the muscle control inputs to a musculoskeletal model of the human legs. Using these synergies as a first guess, a numerical procedure optimizes the relative level of muscle activation within each module and the time course of the weighting coefficients; the objective is to minimize the difference between the results of the forward simulation and the values of the task variables measured experimentally. The walking kinematic and the ground reaction forces are well reproduced by 5 modules, if the motion is constrained in 2D (Neptune et al., 2009), and 6 modules for 3D walking (Allen and Neptune, 2012). Additional simulations reveal that the muscle groups identified during normal walking are able to emulate walking tasks with very different mechanical demands (i.e., change in mass and weight of the models) (McGowan et al., 2010). These results agree with the theoretical considerations formulated by Nori et al. (2008). Finally, this research shows that each module is associated to a specific biomechanical functionality (e.g., body support, forward propulsion, leg swing and balancing).



*** Relation to biological motor control (Computational aspects of control from biological perspective)

%Introduce control strategies in vertebrates and its relationship (optimal and Task-oriented) to muscle synergies
In addition to testify the existence of muscle synergies, the relationship to the act of control has been studied. 
Where do muscle synergies originate from? How are they organized?
%
- synergies are extracted from muscle activations of motor tasks
- consequence of the act of control by the CNS, although the CNS may not implement synergies, but just the outcome of task or biomechanical constraints
- There is strong relationship between the existence of muscle synergies and the control strategies adopted in the CNS
Here two control strategies, task-oriented control strategy and optimal control strategy, that closely related to muscle synergies are introduced. 


**** Task-oriented control strategy
It has been suggested that the existence of the synergies is strongly related to the task-oriented control strategy taken by the CNS. 
- Thus far, the mentioned literature analyzes synergies from muscle activations of various motor tasks with specific task goals.
- task-coordinate or Kinematics coordinate
[Another aspect is that the central nervous system focuses on achieving better control accuracy in terms of the task-space coordinates such as position of a finger tip, rather than focus on joint-space coordinates such as angles of shoulder, elbow and wrist~\cite{atkeson1985kinematic}. 
%
The central nervous system represents limb and target in different coordinates frames, and carries out transformation between the reference coordinates frame during execution of a movement~\cite{snyder2000coordinate}. 
%
A question about which coordinate frame (e.g. task-space coordinate frame which represents positions, a finger, or joint-space coordinate frame which represents angles of a shoulder, elbow and wrist of an arm) is used in the central nervous system during movement generation, has been posed in several literature~\cite{lacquaniti1989central, henis1995mechanisms}. 
%
This concept has been investigated by experimental measurements of variance during movements (e.g. reaching movement), because exerting control reduces error and thus the reference frame that revealed smaller variance would be more likely the central nervous system used in movement generation~\cite{andersen1985encoding}. 
%
Several experimental studies showed that variance in the task-space were smaller than the variance in joint space, either in both human~\cite{haggard1995patterns} and animals~\cite{martin1995kinematic}.]



**** Optimal control strategy
The task-oriented control strategy is about how the encoding mechanism in the CNS. 
%
As mentioned previously, the CNS has to select one of the possible solution (combination of control signals) in producing movement to perform specific tasks.
%
It has been suggested that the CNS produce movements optimally -- It selects an optimal control signals from the inifinite number of solutions according to certain optimal principle in performing a motor task.
%
- minimum intervention Principle, todorov, valero2009structured
- [It has also been suggested that the correlation of motor commands during voluntary movements is closely related to optimization process in the central nervous system~\cite{todorov2004optimality, todorov2005task, latash2002motor, latash2007toward}, stating that the optimization during movement generation results in a phenomenon that leaving objective-unrelated control variables uncontrolled. This phenomenon is call the minimum intervention principle~\cite{todorov2004optimality, todorov2005task}, and is also related to the concept uncontrolled manifold~\cite{latash2002motor, latash2007toward}.]
- together with the Task-oriented control strategy, opitmal control result in low-dimensional input space (tresch)
- Related results are presented by McKay and Ting (2008, 2012). The goal of these studies is to predict the patterns of muscle activities and the ground reaction forces observed experimentally in unrestrained balance tasks with cats (Torres-Oviedo et al., 2006). Muscle contractions for an anatomically-realistic musculoskeletal model of the cat are computed; the used optimization procedure constrains task-related variables (i.e., center of mass) to the experimental results. Although many different cost functions are tested, the best predictions are achieved by minimizing control effort (i.e., total squared muscle activation). Predictions improve if muscle contractions are constrained to linear combinations of the experimentally derived synergies (Torres-Oviedo et al., 2006); however, the overall control effort increases, and the range of admissible ground forces reduces substantially. Furthermore, these studies validate the assumption made by Torres-Oviedo et al. (2006) that the ground reaction forces associated to each synergy rotate as a function of the limb axis. These results suggest that muscle synergies are feasible physiological mechanisms for the implementation of near-optimal or “good-enough” motor behaviors (de Rugy et al., 2012).

** Applications of muscle synergies in robotics

%indicate the engineering purpose is different from biological studies that to find synergies to perform different task 
The modular control based on muscle synergies motivates robotic research to develop synergetic control strategies to reduce control complexity (in the sense of reducing the number of control variable) high dimensional robotic systems.
%
In contrast to biological studies that the objective is to justify (or falsify) the muscle synergies hypothesis, the objective in engineering is to develop controllers for accomplishment of a variety of tasks. 
%
This section highlights several robotic researches that adopt the concept of muscle synergies.





Applications using time-invariant and time-varying synergies
- The work proposed by Mussa-Ivaldi (1997) is one of the first attempts to develop a controller based on the modularity observed in biological systems (Mussa-Ivaldi and Giszter, 1992). The idea is that the motion of a kinematic chain can be determined by a force field applied to its end effector. Inspired by the experiments performed by Giszter et al. (1993), such a force-field results from the linear combination of basic fields, each characterized by a single equilibrium point in operational space. Results show that, for a simulated planar kinematic chain, an appropriate choice of the basis-field coefficients can produce a wide variety of end-effector trajectories. Similarly, Matarić et al. (1999) used force fields to drive joint torque controllers on a rigid-body animated character (Matarić et al., 1998a,b).
- A step forward is taken by Nori and Frezza, who propose a mathematical formulation for a set of actuations (i.e., synergies) that comply with the hypothetical properties of spinal-force fields (Mussa-Ivaldi and Bizzi, 2000). The mathematical description of the synergies is derived from the closed-form solution of an optimal control problem. Additionally, a feedback controller assures that the system follows the desired trajectory toward the synergy equilibrium position. It is proved that the proposed formulation guarantees system controllability2. The synthesized synergies are successfully tested on a simulated two-degrees-of-freedom (dof) planar kinematic chain (Nori, 2005; Nori and Frezza, 2005). to lead the system to a specific equilibrium position (Nori and Frezza, 2005)
- Chhabra and Jacobs (2008) propose a method called Greedy additive regression (GAR). A library of task-specific actuations (synergies) are kept in memory. When a new task has to be performed, a suitable actuation is initially searched in the linear span of these synergies. If the lowest task-error is above a certain threshold, the task will be solved via traditional methods (e.g., feedback error learning), and the obtained actuation will be added to the library. If the library already contains the maximum number of synergies allowed, the least used one will be removed. The obtained results suggest that the synergies synthesized via GAR outperform primitives based on PCA if the dynamical system is non-linear (planar kinematic chain), and there is no statistical difference for linear systems. However, no theoretical explanation is provided.
- n the same vein, Todorov (2009) proved that, for a certain class of stochastic optimal control problems, an appropriate change of variable in the Bellman equation allows to obtain the optimal control policy as a linear combination of some primitives. These primitives are, in turns, solutions to other optimal control problems. Such a method has recently been tested in the context of character animation (da Silva et al., 2009). It is important to clarify that this theory provides a theoretical grounding to the compositionality of optimal control laws, but like GAR it does not provide a method to compute such primitives. In fact, although new efficient methods have been proposed recently, solving an optimal control problem remains quite computationally intense, and it might be unfeasible for systems with a large number of dof.
- here present works without analytical model
- Todorov and Ghahramani (2003) propose a method to synthesize synergies by means of unsupervised learning. Their work emphasizes the role of muscle synergies in an hypothetical hierarchical control scheme similar to the one proposed by Safavynia and Ting (2012): receptive fields translate sensory signals to internal variables, and muscle synergies translate high-level control signals applied to these variables to actual muscle contractions. From this perspective, receptive fields along with motor primitives must form an inverse model of the sensory-motor system. This mapping is learned by fitting a probabilistic model to a dataset of sensory-motor signals generated by actuating the robot with random pulses. The use of the learned synergies as low-level controllers substantially reduces the time needed to learn a desired policy, however, their capability to generalize to additional control laws is not explicitly tested.
- Thomas and Barto (2012) formulate the problem of primitive (i.e., synergy) discovery within the framework of reinforcement learning. In this case, the problem that the agent has to solve is a Markov decision process (MDP), and each primitive is a parameterized feedback control policy. The idea is to identify the optimal parameters that maximize the expected reward for a given task, when the control is restricted to linear combinations of the learned primitives. This method is tested on a simulated planar kinematic chain actuated with artificial muscles. Primitives are identified on reaching tasks, and they are successfully tested in a scenario that involve reaching and avoiding obstacles. This work clearly shows the advantage of a synergy-based framework in terms of learning speed of novel control policies. This method is in essence similar to the one proposed by Alessandro et al. (2012), however, it identifies complete feedback control policies rather then single feedforward synergies.
- from here time-invariant synergies
- Some researchers employ the synchronous synergy model to control the tendon-driven robotic ACT hand (Deshpande et al., 2013) in a reduced dimensional space (Rombokas et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Malhotra et al., 2012). Similarly to Todorov and Ghahramani (2003), dimensionality reduction is applied both in the sensory space and in the actuation space. The “observation synergies” transform sensory readings (tendon lengths) into a lower dimensional variable; the “control synergies” translates synergy-coefficients (as defined in section 2) to motor signals. Model adaptive control and PIDs are applied to the reduced dimensional input, and allow the robotic hand to perform tasks like writing (Rombokas et al., 2011; Malhotra et al., 2012) and playing piano (Zhang et al., 2011). The synergy matrices (observation and control) are computed by applying PCA and NMF to a dataset of tendon-lengths obtained as a result of defined hand motions. 
- Marques et al. (2012) identify synchronous synergies by means of an unsupervised Hebbian-like algorithm that captures the correlations between motor signals and sensory readings. Each synergy thus summarizes the levels of correlation between each motor and one of the sensors. The time modulation of each synergy to solve a given task is then obtained by means of a supervised learning procedure that aims at reducing the task error. Unlike many other works in robotics, the exploratory strategy proposed to generate the dataset of sensory-motor data does not exploit any prior information about the desired motor tasks, therefore muscle synergies are implicitly interpreted as patterns of motor coordinations that solely reflect the biomechanical constraints of the robot. This method has been tested on a single-joint tendon driven robot.
- In the context of robotic hands, many researchers adopted the idea of postural-synergies, or eigengrasps. This concept derived by the observation that the variability of finger postures during human grasps can be explained by a few principal components (Santello et al., 1998), i.e., eigengrasps. Similarly, constraining the finger-joints positions of a robotic hand in such a way that the useful grasping postures can be obtained by superposing a small number of components, would result in a substantial simplification of the graphing problem. Ciocarlie and Allen (2009) derived a theoretical formulation of the problem of stable grasping in the low dimensional space of the postural-synergies; such a formulation is further improved by Gabiccini et al. (2011) for complain grasps. These studies are further analyzed and discussed by Bicchi et al. (2011), who presented them from the point of view of modeling the process of grasping and active touch. Finally, Brown and Asada (2007) proposed a direct mechanical implementation of the eigengrasps. In all these works, the quantitative details of the postural-synergies are taken from human experiments and adapted to the robot mechanical structure; the problem of finding a set of synergies that is optimized for a given robotic hand is left as future research. <- the need for robot to obtain muscle synergies by itself.
- As a final note, it is important to say that the concept of modularity has been employed in robot control in many other ways. In most of these works modules are defined as kinematic-based controllers that are combined sequentially to obtain complex joint trajectories (Khansari-Zadeh and Billard, 2011; Ijspeert et al., 2013). In this regard, these works are more related to the concept of kinematic stroke than to muscle synergies (Pollick et al., 2009).

** part 1
   
*** Motivation
    To show the objective is to verify the feasibility of utilizing synergies
    
    - preceded by the thesis overview slide showing the two issues

**** Objective (concerning about the two questions in overview)
     - to verify feasibility of dimensionality reduction in control utilizing synergies
     - to get some hints about synergies extraction
       (the problem of how to extract is about studying innate properties of data sample source)
       - study synergies sets that inherit different properties from data sample sources

**** Related works – synergies arisen from optimal movements
     - Studies suggest vertebrates follow certain optimal principle in producing goal-directed movements (Uno et al. 1989)
       - Controller minimizes task goal (e.g distance from target) + certain criterion (e.g. control effort)
     - Synergies can be extracted from EMG signals (Yakovenko et al. 2011)
     - Chharab's work where time varying synergies were investigated

*** Methodology
    Briefly description

**** Comparison of synergies extracted from individually optimized control signals ~ 1 slide

***** conceptual diagram
      optimize control signals by certain criterion -> synergies -> control problem
      several flow lines

***** the control problem: reaching task of the human-like robotic arm
      - show figure

***** Different ways of generating data sample source
      - Optimized by goal-related criterion -> achieving-goal synergies
      - optimized by different goal-unrelated criteria -> fitness-optimized synergies
        - weaker constraint on the optimization criterion

***** Capable to solve the control problem in reduced control dimensionality -> Feasible synergies

**** Obtaining Achieving goal synergies

**** Obtaining Fitness-optimized synergies

*** Results and discussion
**** Utilizing achieving goal synergies
**** Comparison with fitness optimized synergies
*** Conclusion
**** Verified synergies can reduce control dimensionality
**** Implications
**** Limitations
***** Require known analytical model
*** Related publications

**** Objective
     - extraction of synergies
       - from data sample without statistical regularities
       - without robot's analytical dynamics model
     - control utilizing synergies

**** Few research has been done

*** Methodology

**** a summary slide
     one slide to give summary of the proposed method
***** Data generation
      - end effector starts from random positions
      - actuated by randomly parameterized control signals
	- no statistical regularities

***** System identification
      - estimate forward and inverse dynamics
      - kernel-based regression

***** Data preprocessing for extraction of synergies
      - estimate corresponding optimal control signals
      - optimality: minimum control effort (Euclidean norm)
      - system identification and quadractic programming

***** Controller
      - following/tracking a desired end effector position trajectory
      - data-driven, based on inverse dynamcis estimates using sliding mode control
      - null-space control for controlling joint

**** Slides for each component in supplimentary slides

*** Results
**** Results of synergies extraction
**** Results of utilizing synergies in control

*** Conclusion
    
**** proposed method
     - extraction from data sample with statistical regularities
     - proposed to extract synergies from optimal estimates
       - control signals that produce end effector accelerations by minimum control effort
     - System identification based on kernel-based regression
     - Robust task space tracking controller

**** results
     - Synergies were sucessfully extracted
     - A desired trajectory was accurately tracked in reduced control dimensionality
