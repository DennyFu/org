** Muscle synergies

A fundamental question in the study of biological motor control is -- How does the central nervous system (CNS) coordinate many muscles to produce movements and perform various motor tasks.
%
Because of the redundancies of the joints and the muscles of musculoskeletal structure, there are inifinite number of ways (joint configurations at the joint level, combinations of muscle activations at the muslce level) can accomplish a motor task.
%
%This many degree-of-freedom body structure allows performing a task in many different ways thus enhance flexibility~\cite{latash2007toward}, however, also poses a problem in control of selecting a solution because the task requirement provided is insufficient~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
This poses a problem to the CNS to select one of the inifinite number of possible ways to accomplish the motor task because the task requirement provided is insufficient~\cite{ting2007dimensional}. 
%
This problem is known as the degree-of-freedom problem or the Bernstein's problem~\{bernstein1967co}.
%
It has been suggested that the CNS resolves this control difficulty by simplifying control complexity by modularly organizing control variables~\cite{bernstein1967co,latash2007toward}.
%
Examples of such modularity are spinal force field, kinematics strokes and muscle synergies~\cite{flash:2005}.
%

(This section gives a brief introduction about how muscle synergies can simply control complexity. 
%
Interpretations of muscle synergies are also mentioned.)

*** Muscle synergies simplify control 

A muscle synergy represents co-activation pattern of a group of muscles~\cite{tresch2009case}. 
%
It has been suggested that the central nervous system resolves this control difficulty by simplifying control complexity -- coordinating muscle synergies to produce a movement but not controlling muscles independently~\cite{lee1984neuromotor, d2003combinations}.

*** Motivation
    To show the objective is to verify the feasibility of utilizing synergies

**** Objective (concerning about the two questions in overview)
     - to verify feasibility of dimensionality reduction in control utilizing synergies

       - study synergies sets that inherit different properties from data sample sources

**** Related works – synergies arisen from optimal movements
     - Studies suggest vertebrates follow certain optimal principle in producing goal-directed movements (Uno et al. 1989)
       - Controller minimizes task goal (e.g distance from target) + certain criterion (e.g. control effort)
     - Synergies can be extracted from EMG signals (Yakovenko et al. 2011)
     - Chharab's work where time varying synergies were investigated
