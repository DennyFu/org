  - 4rd paragraph: Clearly list out the contributions using the proposed FEM-based design 
    1) Novel structural design to improve the stiffness and durability (section [[Structural design]])
       - dump-bell-shaped actuation chamber
    2) FEM methods for simulating the effects of including working channel (section [[FEM-based modeling and response characterization]])
       - e.g. buckling
    3) The smallest soft continuum robot with working channel (Ã¸xmm) for endoscopic interventions (section [[Results and discussion]])
       - how much output force?
       - smallest too aggressive?


* Materials and methods                                            


** Design and performance requirements
   - specify the target application -- colonoscopy

   - a working channel is preserved
     - for biopsy, suction, irrigation, and other instruments
     - give common dimension of clinically-used instruments (e.g. biopsy forceps)
       - dimensions in specific applications: e.g. colonoscopy
     - requirement for the diameter: the larger the better
       - specify a dimension for the prototype in this paper

   - target dimension: Outer diameter and length
     - why such dimension?
       - clinical reason

   - The requirement of bending behavior
     - curvature ratio
     - 

   - constrained elongation
     - i.e. only bending without much elongation 
     - why?
       - camera is mount at the tip. bending with large elongation will cause loss of tracked vision target in the endoscopic view

   - How stiff should the scope be? - the key problem of this paper
     - sufficient to be stable during instrument manipulation
     - sufficient to withstand high input pressure
     - we use FEM simulations to characterize the stiffness properties

   - Durability
     - long life cycle 

   - actuation method - fluidic actuation 
     - advantages of fluidically driven - can be only Hydraulic/pneumatic
       - safe without internal electric component or some toxic component
       - hydraulic: incompressible transmission media gives fast response, ...
       - pneumatic: ease of assembly, ...
       - MRI-compatible
       - a sentence about the control method
       - why not tendon-driven? (move to discussion section)?
	 - here we may need to mention also the advantages of tendon-driven soft continuum robot

   - discuss difficulties of miniaturization - the inclusion of working channel
     - mention the state-of-the-art (smallest) soft robot dimension (for colonoscopy)
     - difficulties of including a central working channel
       - weaken structure
       - reduced volume of material --> less elongation and thus smaller bending curvature
     - are we the first soft robot with working channel of that small dimension?

   - Assume that the camera and LED are not considered during simulation, but they are included in the real prototype. 


** Structural design
   - the actuation response depends on the structural design
     - the geometric design of the actuation chambers and internal tubings
     - materials
     - fabrication process
   - we use FEA to simulate the kinematic and dynamics behaviour in the design optimization process, regarding to the first two factors

   - we can first give the design using fan-shaped actuation chambers
   - then use FEM to demonstrate the weak points at the chamber corners
   - then provide the dump-bell-shaped design

*** Geometrical design of actuation chambers

   - constraint layers
     - where are the constraint layers
     - what are the benefits of the constraint layers?
     - why they are necessary?
   - dimension of the working channel
     - to match requirement mention in [[Design and performance requirements]]

   - actuation chamber design - 2nd version: the dump-bell shaped
     - thicker walls between the chambers and the central channel
     - no-corner chambers
     - why?
       - during actuation, high stress are found in the fan-shaped chambers 
	 - in the walls between the chambers and the central channel
	 - at the corners

     #+NAME: fig:FEA_3D_external_tipforce
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth :placement [!h]
     [[./fig/fig-FEA_3D_external_tipforce.png]]


    
   - simulate bending performance: ratio = curvature/length
   - bending force 
     - what is bending force? the force at the tip ?
     - the force with the same direction with the tip movement


   - how to estimate stiffness?
     - applying a force to the inner wall of the working channel
     - stiffness = force / displacement


   - we need to simulate the stress acting on the embedded tubings?
     - can we simulate the buckling of the tubing? when and how the buckling occurs?
     - as including a central channel is also the key difference from the literature, such simulation will be the novelty of the method
     - buckling causes collapse and thus malfunction of the central channel.

     - lower ratio means better bending degree
     - both FEA and real robot results
     - real robot data of different preloaded pressure
     - 2 figures:
       1) ratio vs chamber pressure
       2) length vs chamber pressure
     - expected results
       - 

   - workspace analysis
     - real robot data is enough
     - actuation of 1 and 2 chamber
       - using random chamber pressure
       - uniform distribution
     - 1 result figure
       - a 3D surface plot of the tip position
       - with some vectors showing the tip directions when adding more pressure at the 3 chambers
     - to show if the resulting cloud points are evenly distributed
       - if the relationship of bending vs pressure is linear, the cloud points should be evenly distributed
     - expected results
       - 


   - (Assessment of motion coplanarity - optional)
     - to examine if the bending is in a fixed plane
     - FEA may not reveal the coplanarity, because this might be due to some technical problems in the fabrication process, such as uneven material density
     - how to quantitatively measure the coplanarity?
       - for each bending from 0 to max degree
       - obtain instantaneous velocities $\{\bm{v}^{tip}\}_{k}$ of the tip at time step $k$.
	 - $k=0,...,N$ indicates the time step 
	 - let $\bm{n}_{\theat}$ be the normal vector of the bending plane
	   - $0\geq\theta\geq 2\pi$
	 - kinematics of the tip can be obtained using EM tracker
       - a scalar performance index evaluates if two consecutive velocities $\bm{v}^{tip}_{i}$ and $\bm{v}^{tip}_{i+1}$ stay on the bending plane
	 - $J = (\bm{v}^{tip}_{i} \times \bm{v}^{tip}_{(i+1)}) \cdot \bm{n}_{\theta}$
       - index closer to 0 means more coplanar bending 
     - figures

  - experiment settings
    - fig of the setting
      - the robot base is fixed on a robotic platform
      - the tip of the robot is pulled by an external force
	- pull until the tip is displaced (e.g. several mm)
      - the platform is tilted to ensure the pulling force acts perpendicularly to the robot pointing direction
      - the test is repeated with different robot bending angle
    - how to measure the force?
      - type and name of the sensors
    - how to measure the displacement?
      - EM tracking system?
      - Image analysis system?
    - conditions
      - actuation of 1 chamber
      - actuation of 2 chambers
      - different preloaded pressure
      - 


  - stiffer robot requires larger forces to displace the tip
  - Assessment of the stiffness - ratio: $\frac{\textrm{pulling force}}{\textrm{tip displacement}}$
    1) min. force required to move the tip
    2) displacement of the tip when accelerating a biopsy forceps (or a catheter) inserted in the central channel
  - 2 result figures
    1) force vs preloaded pressure
       - several curves for different chamber pressure 
    2) displacement of the tip vs acceleration of the inserted instrument
  - expected results
    - for 1)
      - larger force will be required when larger pressure is preloaded
      - at the same prelaoded pressure but with different chamber pressure, the values of the force required would be similar. Since a chamber pressure = a curvature ratio, we will similar stiffness for various curvature ratio.
    - for 2)
      - Two increasing slopes will be observed.
      - more gentle slope before a certain value of the acceleration, the tip displacement will be insignificant. 
      - A steeper slope after the value of acceleration.

  - experiment settings
    1) for step response and frequency response:
       - the same setting as the bending test in section [[Quasi-static bending behavior]]
       - giving step input and sine input for the chamber pressure instead
    2) for tip force output
       - the same setting as the stiffness test in section [[Stiffness analysis]] 
       - not pull the tip, but giving pressure to the robot instead
       - measure the force at the tip
       - the force is perpendicular to the tip's pointing direction
  - actuation condition
    - 1 chamber actuation
    - 2 chambers actuation
    - different preloaded pressure
    - 
  - assessment of the dynamic response
    1) tip force output
    2) step response - typical performance indexes
       - e.g. rise time
       - e.g. transient response
       - e.g. overshoot
    3) frequency response - typical performance indexes
       - frequency response plots
  - result figures
    1) tip force vs preloaded pressure
       - several curves for different chamber pressure (i.e. curvature ratio) 
    2) time history of the tip displacement
       - several curves for different preloaded pressure (i.e. curvature ratio) 
    3) frequency response plots

  - experiment settings
    - increase the chamber pressure up to the maximum bending angle
    - measure the boundary curvature ratio
    - measure the tip force output
    - measure the life cycle
  - condition
    - actuation of 1 chamber
    - actuation of 2 chambers
    - different preloaded pressure
    - 
    - run until failure

  - Assessment of the performance limits
    1) The maximum curvature achieved
       - curvature ratio of different preloaded pressure
       - can reuse/interpret the data obtained in the bending experiment in section [[Quasi-static bending behavior]]
       - 
    2) The maximum stiffness achieved
       - define stiffness index = ratio: $\frac{\textrm{pulling force}}{\textrm{tip displacement}}$
       - stiffness of different preloaded pressure
       - can reuse/interpret the data obtained in the bending experiment in section [[Stiffness analysis]]
       - 
    3) life cycle 
       - life cycle for different preloaded pressure
	 - 2 chamber actuated
  - result figures
    1) max. curvature ratio vs max. stiffness
       - each point represents the value of a specific preloaded pressure 
    2) life cycle
       - life cycle vs curvature ratio (~strain)
	 - several curves for different preloaded pressure 
  - expected results
    - for 1) lower preloaded pressure will have lower stiffness and curvature ratio
    - for 2) using lower pressure will have longer life
