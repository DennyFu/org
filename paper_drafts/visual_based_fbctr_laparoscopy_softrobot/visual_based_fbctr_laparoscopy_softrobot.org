  - Why do we use soft robot for endoscopy
    # what is the purpose of endoscope
    - Endoscope is an tubular instrument for intra-cavitary or intra-luminal inspection in minimal invasive surgical procedure.
    # Conventional endoscope and its design characteristic
    - In conventional design, an endoscope comprises of a long and flexible body and a cable-driven steerable tip mounted with a camera.
    - This slender body is pliant to the surrounding objects, which facilitates versatile operations within the confined surgical environments.
    - The orientation of the tip can be manipulated by antagonistically adjusting the tensions and positions of the embedded cables.
    - This allows directing the camera and delivering interventional instruments such as biopsy forceps at particular regions of interest.
    # Disadvantages of the conventional design that motivates the use of soft robot
    - However, the cable tensions are difficult to control [ref] for stable interventional procedures.
    - The rigidity of tip may also cause damage to the soft tissue or even perforation [ref] when the endoscope is forced to pass through narrow corners against interior luminal surfaces.
    - These drawbacks motivate the development of totally soft, fluid-driven continuum robotic systems for endoscopic interventions.
    # advantages of soft continuum robots
    - Soft continuum structure can be readily fabricated from hyperelastic materials such as silicone (e.g. Ecoflex) using advanced 3D-printed technologies [ref: pnet]. 
    - This enables production of low-cost and disposable soft endoscopes to facilitate sterilization process, where the risk of cross infection would be minimized [ref].

    # control is difficult 
    - Yet the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the deformable structure is usually highly nonlinear and is easily complicated by external disturbances.
    - Consequently the responses upon actuation can be dramatically unalike at different robot configurations.

      - Model-based controllers could be applied to regulate either cable-driven [ref] or fluid-driven continuum robots [ref], and even generate bio-mimicking sterotyped motions [ref].
      - However, the assumptions made could be invalid in the presence of disturbances such as payload and external interactions.
      - Complicated procedures are also required to determine proper analytical models and system parameters beforehand [ref].

    # why soft continuum robots
  Endoscopes are flexible and slender instruments for intra-luminal/intra-cavitary inspections in minimally invasive surgical procedures.
  Conventional endoscopes comprise of flexible metallic skeleton and steerable tip driven by embedded steel cables [refs].
  Such flexible continuum structure is pliant to the surrounding objects, thereby facilitating compliant interactions within confined cavity.
  However, the rigid distal tip may still induce trauma on the soft tissue, when the instrument is pushed against the interior wall inside confined lumen or cavity [ref].
  This motivates the development of totally soft, fluid-driven continuum robots for endoscopic interventions [ref of examples]. 
  The steerable tip can be made of hyperelastic materials such as silicone outright [ref: pnet]. 
  This also allows fabrication of low-cost disposable instrument to simplify sterilization and prevent cross infection.
  Yet, due to the deformable mechanical properties, the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the scope is highly nonlinear [ref sup. highly nonlinear claims].
  This prompts the need of adaptive robotic controller that can account for such nonlinear motion and external disturbance in order to enhance the manipulation accuracy in constrained environments.
      
  Various close-loop control methods have been proposed for soft continuum robots.

    - The control performance of the soft robots can be enhanced by implementation of close-loop controllers.
    - The real-time endsocopic image feedback can be used to close the loop of the robotic control.
    - difficulty of miniaturization while installing other tethered positional sensors
      - reliable sensors are mostly tethered. including tethered sensor would complicate the dynamics of the soft continuum robot and thus increase control difficulty
    - examples of using visual-feedback for robotizing endoscopes
      - visual-based feedback is also mostly use for surgical tool tracking. visual-based controller of the surgical tools is developed making use of 
the tracked position.

    - control of a soft continuum robot, which mounted with camera at the tip, using only visual feedback
    - what is the state-of-the art the visual-servoing for manipulation of endoscope?

* Materials and methods                                            
  
** Overall control architecture for tele-manipulation
- Explanation of the tele-manipulation in endoscopic navigation
  - Fig.1 : Schematic diagram of the overall control architecture
  - Components: the user input, the controller, the robot, the endoscopic camera

- Definition of the control problem
  - redundantly actuated soft robot
    - Fig. 2: sketch of the soft robot 
  - we consider operational space control
    - 

** Real-time image processing 
   - what is the output of the image processing
     - the displacement in the endoscopic view
     - use filter technique to smooth the output
     - is the smoothing technique specific for the endoscopic environment?

** Model-free Kinematic control 
*** Kinematic transition of soft continuum robot
    - general nonlinear function to describe the kinematic relation
      - why quasi-static?
	- robot tip motion should be gentle for smooth output in the endoscopic view
	- large pressure change must be prohibited
      - quasi-static transition model [ref]
	- the robot is in stationary condition at time step $k$ with static chamber pressure $\bm{u}_k$ 
	- the robot state is represented $\bm{x}_k$
      - when the chamber pressure is changed by $\Delta\bm{u}_k$, the state at the next time step is:
      - $\bm{x}_{k+1} = f(\bm{x}_k,\Delta\bm{u}_k, \bm{\eta}_k)$ or $\bm{x}_{k+1} = f(\bm{x}_k,\Delta\bm{u}_k) + \bm{\eta}_k$
      - where $bm{\eta}_k$ is unknown external disturbance
	- e.g. ???
      - kinematics relative to a base frame
	- indicate in Fig. 2 
      - In endoscopic procedure, image feedback is the only available feedback to close the robotic control loop
      - The tip orientation $\bm{y}_k$, and the corresponding image output $\bm{z}$ are 
	- $\bm{y}_k = g_e(\bm{x}_k)$
	- $\bm{z}_k = g_c(\bm{y}_k) + \bm{\tilde \epsilon}_k$
	- where \bm{\epsilon}_k is the measurement noise
    - During the tele-manipulation process, the desired target $\bm{z}_{k+1}^*$ is given by the operator via the user input.
    - Therefore, the controller needs to compute the required change of chamber pressure $\Delta \bm{u}_k$, which can be represented as the inverse kinematic model below:
      - $\Delta \bm{u}=\tilde \pi(\bm{x}, \bm{\eta}, \bm{z}_k, \bm{z}_{k+1}^{*}) + \bm{\epsilon}$
      - $\bm{\epsilon}$ is the noise resulting from the measurement inaccuracy 
    - however, $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{\eta}$ are unknown.
    - Under the quasi-static transition behavior, we hypothesize that the pressure $\bm{u}_k$ can provide information of the state $\bm{x}_k$.
    - Besides, the controller have to adapt the external disturbance $\bm{\eta}_k$, which inherently affects the robot transition.
    - Therefore, we propose to adopt online learning technique to acquire the following approximated inverse model from measurement data:
    - $\Delta \bm{u}= \pi(\bm{u}, \bm{z}_k, \bm{z}_{k+1}^{*}) + \bm{\epsilon}$

*** Estimation of the absolute position from real-time visual feedback
    - use image displacement and the chamber pressure at the last time step to estimate the absolute orientation
    - $\bm{\hat s}_k = h(\Delta \bm{z}_k,\bm{u}_{k-1})$
    - this estimation will be employed in the model-free controller described below.

*** Learning the inverse model for operational space control
    - brief introduction of online nonparametric method
      - advantages of directly learning the inverse
	- low gain feedback controller
      - difficulty in directly learning the inverse
	- redundancy problem in the control space
    - proposed our method
      - how to resolve the redundancy problem
    - discuss the difference from related works regarding the learning/control methods

    # control is difficult 
    Yet, the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the deformable structure is usually highly nonlinear and is easily complicated by external disturbances, consequently the responses upon actuation can be dramatically unalike at different robot configurations. This poses difficulties in developing control methods for the continuum device. Various control methods, either based on complicated analytical models [] or machine learing techniques [], have been developed for soft continuum structure, depicting their potentials for precise manipulation of soft endsocopic devices. However, these advance methods have mostly assumed the presence of accurate sensors. Furthermore, constrained by the robot size and specific surgical procedures, endoscopic camera would be the only source for real-time positional feedback. This necessitates visual-based close-loop control methods, namely visual-seroving, to enhance the manipulability of endoscopic devices.  

    In this study, we will investiage novel visual-servoing techniques for enhancing the tele-manipulation precision of soft, fluid-driven endoscopes. The study aims at ultimately application of the soft endoscopic devices in real practice. Therefore the research will also include from algorithmic inventions such of control methods, intuitive human robot interface, to hardware developments such as advance fabrication techniques. To evaluate the performance of the visual-servoing in terms of enhancing the manipulation precision, subject tests will be conducted in simulated endoscopic procedures.

Chinese medicine (CM) diagnosis has drawn increasing attention on its scientific and clinical values, along with its rising popularity and acceptance worldwide. Tongue and pulse diagnosis are two of the four major diagnoses in CM consultation and have been practiced for over two thousand years (1). They serve as a benchmark for effectively monitoring patient’s condition in accord with the trend of non-invasive and pain-free diagnostics (2). The growing recognition of developing the preventive medical system for healthcare has placed CM diagnosis an important position. Furthermore, in pulse diagnosis, modern clinical studies have demonstrated that such pulse signal elements contain vital health information of particular organs, including not only the heart, but also the whole circulation status (3). In other words, from no matter the development trend of diagnostics or the current study situation, researches on quantifying such two diagnosis results are of profound meaning and great promise in integrative Chinese and western medicine. Numerous research efforts have been made on quantifying such two diagnosis results since 1950’s with the aim to substantiate their scientific base as well as their clinical values. Such efforts included development of tongue image and pulse signal acquisition, characterization and analysis.


Although current advances of sensing, imaging techniques allow for accurate acquisition of tongue and pulse diagnosis data, heavily relying on the signal processing or computer-based analysis of such data for identifying disease or patient’s health status is the common pitfall in existing research. The existing CM systems or devices are not capable of providing user-friendly interaction with clinical fellows during the CM consultation sessions, and currently, there is no uniform nor standard protocol to quantify or analyse the measured tongue and pulse assessment data for further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures by means of either Chinese or western medicine, not to mention their integrative approaches. Therefore, the overall goal of this study is not only to develop and validate sensing and imaging devices for tongue and pulse diagnosis assessment, but also a software system that could enable instant, flexible interfacing with the clinical fellows for their adjustment and confirmation of the measured CM diagnosis results.

Recently, our team developed hardware and software systems to ensure robust quantitative assessments of the tongue and pulse observation. In this study, we will investigate a series of tongue images and pulse signal descriptors that could comprehensively depict the diagnosis features. A new presentation and illustration protocol of the CM diagnosis indices, such as visual diagrams and figures, will also be proposed, thus providing readable, consistent and reliable assessment record for further follow-up with integrative Chinese and western medical treatments. The proposed hardware system involves tongue imaging and pulse sensing devices, which will be designed specific for standardizing the CM quantitative assessment, but without causing intrusion into the current routines of CM consultation.
