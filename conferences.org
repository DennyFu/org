** Justin

*** A method for sensoring soft actuators and its appication to the RBO Hand 2
**** contribution
     - a learning algorithm a determine a good sensor layout and eliminate redundant sensors
     - sensor-agnostic
     - modular liquid metal sensors

*** JammJoint: A variable stiffness device based on granular jamming for wearable joint support

**** contribution
     - wearable robot , portable
     - very stiffness
     - larger compliant cubed granular media instead of fine grains, resulting in a more linear relationship between vacuum pressure and stiffness
     - each column/ring is coupled to each other
     - still very bulky
