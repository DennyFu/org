- Objective:
  - To find out the state-of-the-art visual-servoing methods for laparoscopy and the current limitations, and
  - Search for existing engineering methods that can contribute to the robotic colonoscopy

** why visual servoing is important ?
** what is the state-of-the art visual servoing methods
*** methods for colonoscopy
*** state-of-the-art methods in other endoscopic procedure
*** state-of-the-art methods in robotics, especially in soft robots
** what are their limitations in the state-of-the art methods?
** what approaches/techniques can contribute to the state-of-the-art methods?
*** can the approach/algorithm resolve the current limitations?
*** is the approach/algorithm is theoretically/algorithmically novel?
*** can the approach/algorithm bring something new to the colonoscopy, and even applicable to other endoscopic procedures and robotic applications?
