** src meeting 27 Jul
*** felix
**** camera module supplier visit
***** MISUMI
***** CHIYI
***** JPP

***** image quality
- vga/720p might not have significant different
- FOV > 120 deg
- depth of field
- 2 meter transmission for 1080p is challenging compromising size and cost
  - shielding not considered yet
  - 
- with lighting

***** custum made RFQ progress
- MISUMI
- CHIYI
  - studying whole module
- JPP
- check photo

*** our team 

**** simulator 
ck comments:
- longer decending colon fixture and rectum fixture
- only way to sucess is to deflate the colon so that the acute angle can be reduce at the semi colon
  - israel assumption: based on the inflation of ballon but that will not exacerate the acute angle at the semi-colon

**** filtering
- ck: potential problem
  - filer overlapped the bending section
**** tubing
- ck likes the without shape edge one
**** shorten balloon 

**** Routing of tubing

ck on inner tube balloon design
- separte ballon from felix idea
  - one balloon at the front and one balloon at hte end of bendable section
  - filter wrap the whole bendable section
    - unknown the anchoring effect
  - proved workable by jimmy
- only one distal balloon 
- maybe outer tube is not necessary for colonoscopy
- soft robot is much more prefer than tendon driven
- need to confirm the inner tube ballon design ASAP (by next week)


- ck one more time emphasize if camera can see the lumen
  - if this work everything can done


marco
- difficult for miniaturization
- 3mm for biopsy channel is a must from ck 

**** timeline
- major change of bendable section designed require 3 months

**** 

** Neoguide Colonoscope

*** notes - 2016-07-05
**** ballon
- need to confirm ballon design and quantity
- to order more outuber ballons
  - pay by luis
  - will be arrived in 2 months
- tim

**** tube
- ordered tubes with different stiffness
- tim

**** pump
- sourcing by dr. tse
- to test how much power should to use

**** filter
- to find proper filter
- or solution to use larger radius for suction
  - will enlarge both inner and other tube
    - tube will be needed x-symmetric
- test 2mm (first) and 3mm suction with long tube and new pump and flow rate sensors


**** test locomotion with ballon placing at the front
- without bendable section first 

**** find info for bending curvature of optical fibers

**** test faster response using faster stepper motor
- braided tube = biopsy
- smaller bendable section to put inside outer tube 
- faster stepper motor/better linear track/larger cylinder

**** wiring 
- on braided tube = sourcing by chimlee
- alternative solution - flexible pcb
