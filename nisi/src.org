*** notes - 2016-07-05
**** ballon
- need to confirm ballon design and quantity
- to order more outuber ballons
  - pay by luis
  - will be arrived in 2 months
- tim

**** tube
- ordered tubes with different stiffness
- tim

**** pump
- sourcing by dr. tse
- to test how much power should to use

**** filter
- to find proper filter
- or solution to use larger radius for suction
  - will enlarge both inner and other tube
    - tube will be needed x-symmetric
- test 2mm (first) and 3mm suction with long tube and new pump and flow rate sensors


**** test locomotion with ballon placing at the front
- without bendable section first 

**** find info for bending curvature of optical fibers

**** test faster response using faster stepper motor
- braided tube = biopsy
- smaller bendable section to put inside outer tube 
- faster stepper motor/better linear track/larger cylinder

**** wiring 
- on braided tube = sourcing by chimlee
- alternative solution - flexible pcb
