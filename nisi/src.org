*** engineering publication
    - direction:
      1. design optimization for endoscopy (for NISI)
	 - with working channel
	 - advanced FEM formulations for simulating the interaction with surgical instruments in the working channel
	 - describe clearly what are the bottleneck that we have overcome? and also the contribution
	 - validation with the real robot
      2. advanced mechanical properties of our soft actuator (Advanced materials )
	 - high power density, highly extensible
	 - what are the tricks to enable such advance properties
	   - fabrication, geometric design, advanced FEM formulations
	 - list and demonstrates several potential applications
      3. From the bio-inspired point of view
	 - mimicking biological movements
	   - brian: Chameleons tongue movement
	   - why such biological movements are important?
	   - what are the characteristics of the biological movements
	   - what are the potential applications
      4. IMU
	 - embedded with IMU
	 - advance formulation for sensing curvature
      5. Visual-servoing of a soft endoscope
	 - image-based feedback only
	 - can be simulation only
	 - for endoscopy
	 - state the contribution clearly
	   - only claiming "the visual-servoing of a soft endoscope" seems not enough, not specific
	   - list out specific difficulties/bottleneck or special clinical objectives, and how do we solve for these difficulties
	     - e.g. auto tracking and steering to lumen center, prediction of the ongoing lumen direction.
	     - 
      6. Dynamic control of a soft endoscope
	 - stiffness control/force control of the soft actuator
	 - we need a force sensor or a mechanism to estimate the resulting stiffness/force
	 - what is the target application or function that we want the endoscope to have
	   - e.g. to maintain a specific stiffness 
	   - e.g. to maintain a constant contact force with the soft tissue

**** notes of CK visit on 2016-10-12
    
***** CK notes
      - about the inner tube
	- at least can propagate to the decending colon using only the inner tube with balloon Anchorage
      - about the outer tube main function
	- fix the morphology of the straighten "alpha loop"
	- as a base at the decending colon, preventing further streching of the colon segement that have already passed, hence reduce discomfort during colonoscopy
      - about normal human rectum length
	- 8-12 cm

      - about with the aid of the outer tube to pass through the "alpha loop"
	- the presence of outer tube increases manipulation difficulties of surgeon, leading to inefficient colonoscopy procedure

      - about the biopsy/working channel
	- he said it is a must for the cadaveric trial at the beginning, but gradually changing to "strongly encourage to have biopsy channel"
	- we need better cable management of the camera wires to include the biopsy channel
	- the working channel exit can be not centered
	  - olympus one's is not centered

      - about advantages of disposable colonoscope
	- current situation
	  - expensive
	    - setting the equipment for colonoscopy is expensive
	    - high maintainance cost
	    - even not common in china, only popular in big cities
	  - need expertise skill of colonoscopy
	    - surgeons have to be well-trained to conduct colonoscopy
	      - skills to navigate inside the colon
	- disposable colonoscope
	  - no experties skill is needed
	    - with the aid of ancharage system, the navigation skill, i.e. straightening the colon, is relatively simpler compared to the conventional one
	  - the reduction of cost and skills required increase popularity of colonoscopy
	    - enable remote monitoring and even manipulation with the aid of tele-operation technology

	- about publications
	  - engineering first, then clinical
	  - engineering papers
	    - FEA based analysis for design and analysis of soft robot colonoscopy
	      - with working channel
	      - simulating the effect when instrument is insert
	    - we said we also need the real robot prototype for valiation

    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-01-06 Fri 20:49]
    - new features demonstrated
      - with insertion tube for better force/torque transmission
      - faster response
      - better bendable section rigidity
      - track-ball control

    - he tried twice
      - balloon was detached during the 1st trial

    - simulator's rubber bands blocked the advancement 

    - Dr. Foo's comments
      - he wants fine adjustment when move slowly
      - the insertion tube did helps for advancement because of better force/torque transmission
	- easier to push forward
      - other functions works fine
      - could not confirm if straightening was effectively done
	- because balloon was detached during the 1st trial

    - Comments on the subject test using phantom 
      - he did agree with the following setting
	- load cell under a phantom to estimate the reaction force 
	  - load cell can measure 3D force
	- subject test to measuring completion time
	- EM trackers to measure the real-time position of the scope

    - Unlooping techniques
      - after pulling (unloop), use external pressure to prevent reoccurring of looping
	- the external pressure constrain the shape to straightened colon after pulling

    - next publication
      - animal study
      - quick study
    - study of the working envelop
      - simulation
      - compare with the da vinci
	- robotic arms are inserted via predetermined holes
	  - the holes are opened for specific target
	- the arms can't reach other regions
	  - can't do multi-regions surgery
      - need a good protocol 
      - start to prove with the simulation, phantom study and finally the pig study
*** Dr. C. C. Foo commented on the Cadaveric trial <2016-12-07 Wed 11:00>
    - Cyberport
    - Dr. Foo suggested live pig trial
    - Suggest to improve rigidity, control response and insufflation
      - rigidity
	- to 
      - control response
	- not the moving speed but the reaction latency
      - insufflation
	- olympus can insufflate easily
	- he wants to have fast insufflation effect as olympus
    - Dr. Foo on technique of avoiding looping
      - avoid the first loop
	- once the loop happens the first time, the second can ocurrs easily
      - not the force against resistance

*** notes - 2016-08-12
- filter surround a twin-balloon set
  - filter large facel particles
  - ck: water is unavoidable
  - 
- experiment
  - only litte fluid passing thru the suction channel
- nisi exp.
  - ck: the distance between the twin balloon doesn't matter
  - ck: further investiage the performance in our setting with larger separation
    - proximal balloon just behind the bendable section
    - we also agree large distance has better suction force
    - need further investigation with different pore size
  - ck: what if all the pore are 100% blocked (academic point of view)
    - 100% submerge is not equivalent to 100% blocked 

- ck: need straighten up the bending section at the same time when pulling the colon 
  - need stiffness to straighten up the bending section


- ck doesn't care about 3 or 4 chamber, whatever the functional prototype can be well-control is fine.
- ck one more time emphasize the importance of the precision control 



*** notes - 5 Aug

**** Fai has improved the colon simulator
- ck agree the improvement

**** locomotion (brian)

- two component
  - sraightening
  - concertina

ck said these two components are both necessary
ck surgeons common sense - can always advance if the lumen center can be found

- 3 design
  - A: single tube with twins balloon will be unfold
    - effective straigtening
    - lumen can be found
    - lumen behind
  - ck said the failure may be due to the lumen behind is not straight enough , pushing the colon forward nullify the advancement
    - happen in inexperienced colonoscopist.
      - 1. straighten the colon
      - 2. see the lumen
      - 3. insulflation
      - 4. deflate the balloon
    - may be due to the wrong position of the sleeve rectum
      - may try shorten the rectum sleeve
  - B: inner + outer tube, twins balloons in both tubes
    - need to put at the tip of the bendable section
    - folding between the two sets of twin balloon
    - insulflation also need at the outer tube beforece advaning the outer tube
      - ck agree that
      - ck does not need hydrofilic coating on the outer tube surface
      - experienced colonoscopist always deflate rather than inflate
      - gental insulflation to only inflate the collapsed lumen

**** update on naneye RS (chimlee)

- expected delivery time: october
- module price 600 usd


**** comparison of 3 and 4 chamber design (nelson)
- bending efficiency
  - actuating 1 chamber and 2 chamber only
  - 4 chamber > 3 chamber in the 2 chamber-actuated  case
  - marco said it is more important to compare the dynamics result rather than the kinematics result

- mapping efficiency
  - 4 chamber > 3 chamber design


- volume compression and pressure study
  - 



- ck said it still deserve to compare the performance of the 3 and 4 chambers design in different aspect
  - based on FEA is better because lab-based results have more uncertainty such as fabrication and etc..

**** camera comparison (johnson)

- still not statisfied

*** notes - 27 Jul
**** felix
***** camera module supplier visit
****** MISUMI
****** CHIYI
****** JPP

****** image quality
- vga/720p might not have significant different
- FOV > 120 deg
- depth of field
- 2 meter transmission for 1080p is challenging compromising size and cost
  - shielding not considered yet
  - 
- with lighting

****** custum made RFQ progress
- MISUMI
- CHIYI
  - studying whole module
- JPP
- check photo

**** our team 

***** simulator 
ck comments:
- longer decending colon fixture and rectum fixture
- only way to sucess is to deflate the colon so that the acute angle can be reduce at the semi colon
  - israel assumption: based on the inflation of ballon but that will not exacerate the acute angle at the semi-colon

***** filtering
- ck: potential problem
  - filer overlapped the bending section
***** tubing
- ck likes the without shape edge one
***** shorten balloon 

***** Routing of tubing

ck on inner tube balloon design
- separte ballon from felix idea
  - one balloon at the front and one balloon at hte end of bendable section
  - filter wrap the whole bendable section
    - unknown the anchoring effect
  - proved workable by jimmy
- only one distal balloon 
- maybe outer tube is not necessary for colonoscopy
- soft robot is much more prefer than tendon driven
- need to confirm the inner tube ballon design ASAP (by next week)


- ck one more time emphasize if camera can see the lumen
  - if this work everything can done


marco
- difficult for miniaturization
- 3mm for biopsy channel is a must from ck 

***** timeline
- major change of bendable section designed require 3 months
